       "      <td>Alphonse Bertillon was a Parisian policeman. He wanted to improve descriptions of suspected criminals, and hoped a good identification system would quickly identify repeat offenders. He believed that people who were liable to reoffend could be identified through physical characteristics, and that people with certain characteristics were more likely to be criminals.\\n\\nBertillon was a friend of the surgeon and anthropologist Paul Broca, and borrowed Broca’s ideas about measuring physical differences. In 1881, Bertillon developed techniques and instruments to measure individual features that would not change, for example eye colour, the shape and angles of the ear, brow and nose, and the distances between them. He also developed ways to reliably record other physical data about the body, including identifying marks such as tattoos. He collected vast quantities of data and used the new technology of photography.\\n\\nBy 1883, Bertillon had made 7336 measurements and identified 49 repeat offenders. By 1884 he had found 241. Bertillon described his system as anthropometry, literally ‘measuring humans’. The system became known as ‘Bertillonage’, and it eventually incorporated body measurements, a verbal description, a photograph and fingerprints. The system relied on progressively sorting records of people with matching characteristics until an individual was identified.\\n\\nBertillonage was initially popular. However, from the 1890s it was superseded by fingerprinting techniques from India. Frances Galton championed their use in forensic science. Fingerprinting proved far simpler for identifying individuals because each person has a unique fingerprint.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Born in Germany, Weil and her sister narrowly escaped the Holocaust arriving in Britain via the Kindertransports in 1939 (her parents also escaped just before the outbreak of war, with her father briefly held in Dachau). She was fostered with an orthodox Jewish family in Bournemouth, and then by Methodists in Purbrook, Hampshire. At 16 she got a job as a parlour maid to a Quaker family. \\n\\nHer first job was at the Oxford Institute of Statistics, where she met the economist E F Schumacher, who suggested she work at The Observer. She started on the paper a few days after her 21st birthday, and devoted the rest of her life to The Observer and its staff from 1945 until 1984. Her job title ‘editorial secretary’ hid a crucial role managing the office and acting as \"Mother Superior\" – to the foreign writers' desk.

       "6328   Alphonse Bertillon was a Parisian policeman. He wanted to improve descriptions of suspected criminals, and hoped a good identification system would quickly identify repeat offenders. He believed that people who were liable to reoffend could be identified through physical characteristics, and that people with certain characteristics were more likely to be criminals.\\n\\nBertillon was a friend of the surgeon and anthropologist Paul Broca, and borrowed Broca’s ideas about measuring physical differences. In 1881, Bertillon developed techniques and instruments to measure individual features that would not change, for example eye colour, the shape and angles of the ear, brow and nose, and the distances between them. He also developed ways to reliably record other physical data about the body, including identifying marks such as tattoos. He collected vast quantities of data and used the new technology of photography.\\n\\nBy 1883, Bertillon had made 7336 measurements and identified 49 repeat offenders. By 1884 he had found 241. Bertillon described his system as anthropometry, literally ‘measuring humans’. The system became known as ‘Bertillonage’, and it eventually incorporated body measurements, a verbal description, a photograph and fingerprints. The system relied on progressively sorting records of people with matching characteristics until an individual was identified.\\n\\nBertillonage was initially popular. However, from the 1890s it was superseded by fingerprinting techniques from India. Frances Galton championed their use in forensic science. Fingerprinting proved far simpler for identifying individuals because each person has a unique fingerprint.   \n",

She was fostered with an orthodox Jewish family in Bournemouth, and then by Methodists in Purbrook, Hampshire. At 16 she got a job as a parlour maid to a Quaker family. \\n\\nHer first job was at the Oxford Institute of Statistics, where she met the economist E F Schumacher, who suggested she work at The Observer. She started on the paper a few days after her 21st birthday, and devoted the rest of her life to The Observer and its staff from 1945 until 1984. Her job title ‘editorial secretary’ hid a crucial role managing the office and acting as \"Mother Superior\" – to the foreign writers' desk. She went on, in retirement, to run Fobs (Friends of The Observer).   \n",
