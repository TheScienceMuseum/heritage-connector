They also came to know the Austrian  conductor Clemens Krauss, and it was his wife, the singer Viorica  Ursuleac who asked the sisters in 1934 to help a Jewish friend to  leave Germany. Having accomplished this, the sisters continued the  work of rescuing Jews and their property from Germany,  pretending to be eccentric opera fanatics willing to go anywhere to  hear a favourite artist.

Most actors and actresses had studio photographs taken, in everyday dress or theatrical costume, for ‘cartes de visite’, and later ‘cabinet cards’.  Both were albumen prints made from glass negatives, attached to stiff card backing printed with the photographer’s name. _x000D_ _x000D_ ‘Cartes de visite’, the size of  formal visiting cards, were patented in 1854 and produced in their millions during the 1860s when it became fashionable to collect them. Their subjects included scenic views, tourist attractions and works of art, as well as portraits. They were superseded in the late 1870s by the larger and sturdier ‘cabinet cards’ whose popularity waned in turn during the 1890s in favour of postcards and studio portraits._x000D_  _x000D_ This photograph comes from a large collection of ‘cartes de visite’ and ‘cabinet cards’ removed from their backings and mounted in albums by Guy Tristram Little (d.1953) who bequeathed them to the V&amp;A.  A collector of greetings cards, games and photographs, Guy Little was a partner in the legal firm Messrs Milles Jennings White &amp; Foster, and the solicitor and executor of Mrs. Gabrielle Enthoven, whose theatrical collection formed the basis of the Theatre Collections at the V&amp;A.

She.started her remarkable collection in the 1890s, in her flat in Cadogan Gardens. As her collection grew she came to the realisation that London was the only European capital without a public collection of theatrical records, and that an institution was needed to take it on as a gift to ensure its future. In 1911 she wrote to The Observer pointing out the need for a central repository of theatrical material that could be generally accessible, suggesting: ‘a comprehensive theatrical section in an existing museum to comprise specimens of all the different branches necessary to the workings of a play from the construction of the theatre, the designing of the scenery and costumes, to the smallest workings necessary in the house. Also a library and a collection of playbills, prints, pictures and relics etc.’_x000D_ _x000D_ After the initial refusal from the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum Cecil Harcourt-Smith to accept her material, Mrs Enthoven remained undeterred; and after the successful and influential International Theatre Exhibition of around 900 theatre designs, brought over from Amsterdam in 1922 and staged at the V&amp;A, Mrs Enthoven renewed her efforts to get the museum to accept her collection and in March 1924 she succeeded.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Jenny Wiener's complex iconic images of measurement are witty explorations of the systems and constraints of mathematics in an aesthetic context. Wiener's practice centres on measurement. She starts from the perception that nothing is as it seems, and uses her analytic mind and quirky humour to question the assumptions and components we use to define and assess, qualify and quantify.  Her concern is that we are increasingly reduced to numbers: serial numbers, pin numbers, illogical scorecards, random statistics and units of measurements - measuring everything and nothing.  In her practice, she selects measures and then applies forensic dissection to varied subject matter , including famous paintings (notably Crivelli and Cezanne) , or as here, the artist's workshop, combining intricate technical drawing with layers of coloured geometric shapes. In his introduction to Wiener's book/catalogue 'Measuring the Tale' Richard Osborne wrote: \"Jenny Wiener's work is subtle, analytical and almost perverse. Almost because it has a wonderful reasoning all of its own, which stretches the logic of measurement to the point where the rigorous patterns of everyday coherence begin to dissolve into the metaphysics of improbability. There is a dash of whimsy, a soupcon of artistry and a great deal of intelligence that go into this mix of the mythical, the numerical and the perceptual. This is postmodern art in the best sense of the word; it is art about the possibilities of art and the probability of perception being confronted by the inadequacies of tradition. Let those who look for reassurance look the other way.\"_x000D_    Print showing isometric diagram of an artist's workshop, printed in shades of yellow, grey, orange, etc.</td>\n",

The size of the box for performers’ names depended on the magnitude of their fame. This advertises a twice-nightly show from the Shepherd's Bush Empire which was to be broadcast live on the radio on the Tuesday night. Lee Lawrence, billed as 'Britain's outstanding singing star', gets the biggest box, with a 26-year old comic: 'Radio's Peter Sellers', a close second. By October 1951 Peter Sellers had made his name in several BBC radio shows including &lt;i&gt;Show Time&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;It's Fine to be Young&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Ray's a Laugh&lt;/i&gt;. In May 1951 he first appeared in another radio show called &lt;i&gt;Crazy People&lt;/i&gt; with Michael Bentine, Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe. By the second series in 1952 the title was changed to &lt;i&gt;The Goon Show&lt;/i&gt;._x000D_ _x000D_ The performers who get one of the two smallest boxes on the bottom of the bill are Morecambe &amp; Wise, later to become the hugely successful comedy double act made famous throughought the country by their own television show broadcast from 1961 until 1968.

There were three elder daughters, Elizabeth, Janet, and Robina. In 1768 when Murray established himself in business at London he dropped the prefix ‘Mc’ from his name. He matriculated at Edinburgh University for one term in 1752. In the following year he began a career in the marines that led to a commission in July 1762. Little is known of his service during the Seven Years' War, after which he retired on half pay. On 3 March 1763 he married, at Chatham, Nancy (bap. 1745, d. 1776), daughter of Captain William Weemss and Ann Weber of Brompton, near Chatham. There were no children from the marriage._x000D_ _x000D_ Murray's search for gainful employment separated him from his wife and brought him to the north of Scotland to work on the Gordonstoun estate and afterwards to Edinburgh, where job opportunities eluded him. He occupied himself in writing a short novel, ‘The History of Sir Launcelot Edgevile’, published in the Court Miscellany, and a pamphlet on the Edinburgh theatre, but realized that he lacked the talent to pursue a literary career with any chance of success. In the spring of 1766 he returned to England and reluctantly was reinstated in the marines at Chatham._x000D_ _x000D_ In October 1768 Murray learned that the well-established London bookselling business of William Sandby at 32 Fleet Street could be bought for £1000. With £700, the sum of his wife's dowry, and the additional funds borrowed from friends, he ventured upon a career about which he knew little or nothing. To the poet William Falconer, who declined to be a partner, he remarked: ‘Many blockheads in the trade are making fortunes’ (Murray letter-book, 16 Oct 1768). Murray's first publication was the fifth edition of Lyttelton's Dialogues of the Dead, a title Sandby had first published in 1760. From his bookshop Murray also sold stationery, and at different times dealt in medicines, lottery tickets, Irish linen, Tassie's gems, beer, wine, and game birds._x000D_ _x000D_ The House of Lords decision of 1774 on literary property enabled Murray to exploit the market for reprinting. He produced inexpensive editions of the poems of Thomas Gray in 1776 and James Thomson in 1778, both enhanced with illustrations and critical assessments. He also bought into such large-scale ventures as the Works of the English Poets, edited by Samuel Johnson. A legal dispute in 1777 with the Revd William Mason over the copyright in three short poems in the Gray edition led Murray to defend himself in public with A Letter to W. Mason Concerning … the</td>\n",

Their subjects included scenic views, tourist attractions and works of art, as well as portraits. They were superseded in the late 1870s by the larger and sturdier ‘cabinet cards’ whose popularity waned in turn during the 1890s in favour of postcards and studio portraits._x000D_  _x000D_ This photograph comes from a large collection of ‘cartes de visite’ and ‘cabinet cards’ removed from their backings and mounted in albums by Guy Tristram Little (d.1953) who bequeathed them to the V&amp;A.

She.started her remarkable collection in the 1890s, in her flat in Cadogan Gardens. As her collection grew she came to the realisation that London was the only European capital without a public collection of theatrical records, and that an institution was needed to take it on as a gift to ensure its future. In 1911 she wrote to The Observer pointing out the need for a central repository of theatrical material that could be generally accessible, suggesting: ‘a comprehensive theatrical section in an existing museum to comprise specimens of all the different branches necessary to the workings of a play from the construction of the theatre, the designing of the scenery and costumes, to the smallest workings necessary in the house. Also a library and a collection of playbills, prints, pictures and relics etc.’_x000D_ _x000D_ After the initial refusal from the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum Cecil Harcourt-Smith to accept her material, Mrs Enthoven remained undeterred; and after the successful and influential International Theatre Exhibition of around 900 theatre designs, brought over from Amsterdam in 1922 and staged at the V&amp;A, Mrs Enthoven renewed her efforts to get the museum to accept her collection and in March 1924 she succeeded.</td>\n",

It has been said that he was probably born in Mildenhall near Marlborough. This same artist is recorded as having painted the scenery for Lord Barrymore's theatre at Wargrave from 1788-92. His obituary mentioned his painting of the Judgement of Solomon dated 1810, presented to the City of Southampton although he is best known as a landscape painter. Several views of Southampton and the surrounding countryside are known to be by him. There seems no question that the artists called John or Tobias Young were related.

His early training is uncertain, but it seems as if he went to Rome at age 13 or so, perhaps as a pastry cook, and then probably went to Naples, where he studied painting. He was highly regarded as an artist. His landscapes depict an image of nature more beautiful and better ordered than nature itself, often including pastoral scenes with shepherds guarding their flocks. He refined the theme, first seen in Venetian painting around 1510, by using light as the principal means both of unifying the composition and of lending beauty to the landscape. His popular works embodied the courtly values of 'high finish' and decorum; among his most important patrons were members of the European nobility and higher clergy.</td>\n",

Given Gilbert’s exacting attitude to his productions it is an accolade to Anderson that he worked with Gilbert on so many, including Gilbert and Edward German’s &lt;i&gt;Fallen Fairies&lt;/i&gt; (1909), when Gilbert said Anderson: ‘surpassed himself’._x000D_ _x000D_ Anderson designed costumes for many other notable late 19th century productions including several by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty’s Theatre, and musical comedies produced by George Edwardes at Daly’s Theatre such as &lt;i&gt;San Toy&lt;/i&gt; (1899) and &lt;i&gt;The Duchess of Dantzig&lt;/i&gt; (1903).

They were superseded in the late 1870s by the larger and sturdier ‘cabinet cards’ whose popularity waned in turn during the 1890s in favour of postcards and studio portraits._x000D_  _x000D_ This photograph comes from a large collection of ‘cartes de visite’ and ‘cabinet cards’ removed from their backings and mounted in albums by Guy Tristram Little (d.1953) who bequeathed them to the V&amp;A.

She.started her remarkable collection in the 1890s, in her flat in Cadogan Gardens. As her collection grew she came to the realisation that London was the only European capital without a public collection of theatrical records, and that an institution was needed to take it on as a gift to ensure its future. In 1911 she wrote to The Observer pointing out the need for a central repository of theatrical material that could be generally accessible, suggesting: ‘a comprehensive theatrical section in an existing museum to comprise specimens of all the different branches necessary to the workings of a play from the construction of the theatre, the designing of the scenery and costumes, to the smallest workings necessary in the house. Also a library and a collection of playbills, prints, pictures and relics etc.’_x000D_ _x000D_ After the initial refusal from the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum Cecil Harcourt-Smith to accept her material, Mrs Enthoven remained undeterred; and after the successful and influential International Theatre Exhibition of around 900 theatre designs, brought over from Amsterdam in 1922 and staged at the V&amp;A, Mrs Enthoven renewed her efforts to get the museum to accept her collection and in March 1924 she succeeded.</td>\n",

Russell was educated at Guildford grammar school and won premiums from the Society of Artists for drawings in 1759 and 1760. He was apprenticed to Francis Cotes and set up his own practice in 1767. In 1770 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, London, winning the silver medal for figure drawing. He exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1768 and annually at the Royal Academy from 1769 to 1806. He was elected ARA in 1772 and RA in 1788, when he became Crayon Painter to King George III and to George, Prince of Wales. He painted some rather stilted portraits in oil, but most of his work—hundreds of portraits and large numbers of fancy pictures of children with animals—is in pastel.

It was founded by a joiner, Robert Gillow (1703-1772), in or shortly after 1727 in Lancaster. He took his eldest son Richard into partnership in 1757; another son, Robert, went to London in 1776 to run a showroom and warehouse which had been built c. 1765 on the site occupied by their successors, Waring &amp; Gillow in Oxford Street until 1974 (though no member of the family has been connected with the firm since 1817). Their main factory remained in Lancaster and they were much patronized by northern and Scottish gentry, e.g. Duke of Atholl, Earls of Strafford and Derby. They were Roman Catholics and were patronized by their co-religionists, but they undertook extensive commissions in the south, e.g. furnishing Mrs Piozzi's house at Streatham in 1784. And they carried on a lively export trade to the Baltic and the West indies. In the 1760s they began to stamp some pieces of their case furniture, being the first English firm to adopt this practice. They are best known for handsome, well-made but relatively simple furniture in the late Georgian and Regency styles. In the c19 they emplyed several of the leading designer, e.g. T.E. Collcutt and B.J. Talbert. They absorbed Collinson &amp; Lock in 1897 and amalgamated with S.J. Waring &amp; Son shortly afterwards. In the 1930s they employed Serge Chermayeff an P.

       "      <td>French engraver and print publisher of Flemish origin. He was the son of a tailor in Antwerp and trained as an engraver with Gaspar Huybrechts (1619–84) and Cornelis Galle the younger. On arriving in Paris in 1666, he worked with his compatriot Nicolas Pitau the elder, and then with François de Poilly, Robert Nanteuil and Philippe de Champaigne. In 1672 he married the daughter of Nicolas Regnesson, the Parisian engraver and print publisher, thus himself becoming a print publisher. In 1675 he became a naturalized Frenchman and in 1677 was admitted (reçu) to the Académie Royale. In 1695 he was made a Chevalier of the Order of St Michel and a Papal Knight. He became both a councillor at the Académie and Premier Dessinateur du Cabinet du Roi. Among his pupils were his brother Jean Edelinck (b Antwerp, c. 1643; d Paris, 14 May 1680), his godson Nicolas Pitau the younger and Jacques Lubin (c. 1659–after 1703). Edelinck specialized in portraits, which make up two-thirds of his work; he was a reproductive engraver, who translated the works of the most important portraitists of his time, such as Hyacinthe Rigaud (e.g. Charles Colbert, Marquis de Croissy, 1691; see Weigert, no. 121) and Nicolas de Largillierre (e.g. Charles Gobinet, 1691, w 123), and is considered as one of the century’s greatest engravers._x000D_ _x000D_ Gérard Edelinck’s brother Jean Edelinck came to Paris at about the same time as he, and likewise became an engraver, print publisher and print-seller. He made engravings of seven statues from the grotto and gardens of Versailles for the Cabinet du Roi and engraved some portraits, as well as reproducing a good many compositions by Henri Wattelé. Jean Edelinck’s early death prevented him from fully exploiting his talent. Another brother, Gaspard-François Edelinck (b Antwerp, 18 Nov 1652; d Paris, 21 May 1722), was also an engraver. He joined his brothers in Paris, where he seems to have worked mainly in collaboration with Gérard; but c. 20 pieces bearing his signature are known. Nicolas-Etienne Edelinck (b Paris, 9 April 1681; d Paris, 11 May 1767), the eighth son of Gérard Edelinck, also became an engraver; he travelled to Munich, Venice and Rome. His oeuvre, all of it reproductive, numbers only c. 30 prints, mostly portraits, such as that of Gérard Edelinck (1707; see Roux, no. 2) after François Tortebat (c. 1621–90). He also produced some vignettes for books.</td>\n",

He early created a great impression on audiences, partnering the established and younger dancers of the company, including Kschessinska, Preobrajenska, Pavlova and Karsavina.  Soon after graduating, he met Diaghilev who was to be the most important influence on his life and he appeared with the dancers organised by Diaghilev in Paris in 1909, creating a sensation.  The choreographer Michel Fokine created roles for him that emphasised his extraordinary animalistic sexual qualities, such as the Favourite Slave in Scheherazade, his soft poetic lyricism, such as the Poet in Les Sylphides, a mocking humour in Harlequin in Carnaval.  In 1911 he was dismissed from the Imperial Theatres, whether by accident or design, and joined the now permanent company that Diaghilev built around him.  That year saw two of his most famous roles, Le Spectre de la rose and the title role in Petrushka.  In 1912 Diaghilev encouraged him to choreograph, and he produced L'Apres midi d'un faune, the suggestive last movements of which created a satisfying scandal, and followed this with the even more sensational failure Le Sacre du Printemps in 1913.   His association with Diaghilev came to an abrupt end when he married Romola de Pulsky on the 1913 American tour, although he did appear with the Company on its American tour in 1916.  He subsequently settled in Switzerland, but showed increasing signs of instability and he spent the remainder of his life in various institutions and undergoing various treatments.  _x000D_ He was the greatest male dancer of his generation who revolutionised the public perception of the male dancer.  He had amazing elevation and ballon but allied his formidable technique to the expressive qualities of the roles, in which he immersed himself to an almost disturbing degree.</td>\n",

The mixture of comedy sketches and song was popular with holiday makers and the Fol-de-Rols became a regular summer feature. After World War I their producer, George Royle, went into partnership with Greatrex (Rex) Newman, staging Fol-de-Rols shows in Hastings, Westcliff-on-Sea, Eastbourne, Sandown and Llandudno. Royle retired in 1935 but Newman continued to present the shows, for which he wrote much of the material. During World War II the Fol-de-Rols company entertained the troops as part of ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association) and the popularity of the seaside shows continued throughout the 1940s and 50s, with a winter tour being added.  In 1960 Newman sold the Fol-de-Rols to impresarios Jack Hylton and Hugh Charles. Charles took over the running of the shows and continued to present summer seasons and winter tours. Newman still wrote for them, providing topical material and lyrics, but, as the 1960s progressed, the Fol-de-Rols found themselves competing with other forms of entertainment.

They achieved success in the UK and US under the enlightened directorship of Alastair Morton (1910-63), who commissioned freelance designers and artists to produce work for interpretation as printed and woven fabrics. Following Alastair Morton's death, Edinburgh Weavers was taken over by Courtaulds in 1963.   Woven, machine-sewn top and right edges, cut bottom edge and selvedge on left, design of criss-crossing diagonal lines in orange and cream with horizontal stripes in white cotton chenille.

Free, 4 April 1759.  Having regard to the status of Kandler and Archambo this may well indicate a turn over of the apprentice to a member of the Goldsmiths' Company for his freedom, since the former was apparently not free of the Company.  The entry of the mark as largeworker, 12 October 1757 (Adress: South side of St James's Market) provides further doubts.  Firstly it is eighteen months earler than the freedom of William Reynolds, although if he was the same apprentice as Kandler in 1748, he had already nine years at the craft and was obviously competent to work.  But there is another problem.  The name can be read, as Chaffers did, as \"Reynoldson\" or, as seems more possible, \"Reynolds on / South side of St. James Market\".  The latter seems supported by the fact that the Parliamentary Report list 1773 has only William Reynolds, plate worker, Swallow Street, St James's.  Since Archambo and Kandler worked respectively in Coventry Street, and Jermyn Street the likelihood of a pupil remaining in the same general area seems strong and suggests identity between him of St. James's Market in 1757 and Swallow Street in 1773.

During the early years of the 20th century the clothes she made for her younger sister and later for her small daughter attracted so much attention from customers that Lanvin created copies and introduced new lines to sell in her store. Over the following years demand by young women persuaded Lanvin to open a couture house selling matching mother-and-daughter garments. _x000D_ _x000D_ Shortly before World War I she created her famous 'robes de style', based on 18th-century designs. These waisted, full-skirted dresses remained popular until the early 1920s with only slight adjustments. She also designed romantic 'picture' dresses based on softened Victorian shapes and lavishly trimmed with embroidery. Influenced by orientalism from around 1910, Lanvin turned to exotic eveningwear in Eastern-style velvets and satins. _x000D_ _x000D_ At the beginning of World War I she made a simple chemise dress which later became the basic outline for the 1920s. Lanvin's postwar clothes were in the spirit of the age. In 1921 a Riviera collection introduced Aztec embroideries. The following year the Lanvin Breton suit appeared, comprising a gently gathered skirt, a short, braided jacket with lots of small buttons, and a big white organdie collar turning down over a red satin bow. A sailor hat or round straw hat topped the outfit. Lanvin also sold beaded dance dresses, a wool jersey sportsdress patterned in check of gold and silver thread, dinner pyjamas and capes. Her work was easily recognisable by her skilful use of embroidery and her fine craftsmanship. She used a particular shade of blue so often that it came to be called 'Lanvin blue'. _x000D_ _x000D_ Callan, Georgina O'Hara. &lt;font -i&gt;The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Fashion and Fashion Designers&lt;/font -i&gt;.

Most actors and actresses had studio photographs taken, in everyday dress or theatrical costume, for ‘cartes de visite’, and later ‘cabinet cards’.  Both were albumen prints made from glass negatives, attached to stiff card backing printed with the photographer’s name. _x000D_ _x000D_ ‘Cartes de visite’, the size of  formal visiting cards, were patented in 1854 and produced in their millions during the 1860s when it became fashionable to collect them. Their subjects included scenic views, tourist attractions and works of art, as well as portraits. They were superseded in the late 1870s by the larger and sturdier ‘cabinet cards’ whose popularity waned in turn during the 1890s in favour of postcards and studio portraits._x000D_  _x000D_ This photograph comes from a large collection of ‘cartes de visite’ and ‘cabinet cards’ removed from their backings and mounted in albums by Guy Tristram Little (d.1953) who bequeathed them to the V&A.  A collector of greetings cards, games and photographs, Guy Little was a partner in the legal firm Messrs Milles Jennings White & Foster, and the solicitor and executor of Mrs. Gabrielle Enthoven, whose theatrical collection formed the basis of the Theatre Collections at the V&A.

Wiener's practice centres on measurement. She starts from the perception that nothing is as it seems, and uses her analytic mind and quirky humour to question the assumptions and components we use to define and assess, qualify and quantify.  Her concern is that we are increasingly reduced to numbers: serial numbers, pin numbers, illogical scorecards, random statistics and units of measurements - measuring everything and nothing.  In her practice, she selects measures and then applies forensic dissection to varied subject matter , including famous paintings (notably Crivelli and Cezanne) , or as here, the artist's workshop, combining intricate technical drawing with layers of coloured geometric shapes. In his introduction to Wiener's book/catalogue 'Measuring the Tale' Richard Osborne wrote: \"Jenny Wiener's work is subtle, analytical and almost perverse. Almost because it has a wonderful reasoning all of its own, which stretches the logic of measurement to the point where the rigorous patterns of everyday coherence begin to dissolve into the metaphysics of improbability. There is a dash of whimsy, a soupcon of artistry and a great deal of intelligence that go into this mix of the mythical, the numerical and the perceptual. This is postmodern art in the best sense of the word; it is art about the possibilities of art and the probability of perception being confronted by the inadequacies of tradition. Let those who look for reassurance look the other way.\"_x000D_    Print showing isometric diagram of an artist's workshop, printed in shades of yellow, grey, orange, etc.   \n",

The size of the box for performers’ names depended on the magnitude of their fame. This advertises a twice-nightly show from the Shepherd's Bush Empire which was to be broadcast live on the radio on the Tuesday night. Lee Lawrence, billed as 'Britain's outstanding singing star', gets the biggest box, with a 26-year old comic: 'Radio's Peter Sellers', a close second. By October 1951 Peter Sellers had made his name in several BBC radio shows including <i>Show Time</i>, <i>It's Fine to be Young</i>, and <i>Ray's a Laugh</i>. In May 1951 he first appeared in another radio show called <i>Crazy People</i> with Michael Bentine, Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe. By the second series in 1952 the title was changed to <i>The Goon Show</i>._x000D_ _x000D_ The performers who get one of the two smallest boxes on the bottom of the bill are Morecambe & Wise, later to become the hugely successful comedy double act made famous throughought the country by their own television show broadcast from 1961 until 1968.   Typographic poster printed in red and blue on cream paper, with the name of the theatre - Shepherd's Bush Empire - in blue ink against a red textured background at the top of the poster, in a red outlined rectangle, the word 'Empire' printed in large 3-D effect print.  The rest of the poster consists of the names of the performers, in blue and red print, all within variously sized red lined rectangles, the entire text being bordered in red. The name of the printer, bottom left, is in red lettering.   THES48863 - Mass produced   \n",

They were sold - or often given away - for a wide variety of purposes. Some advertised bands and their records, or other products, but many were created to promote ideas and political causes, or simply to give amusement through the use of original images and provocative slogans._x000D_ _x000D_ Barry Miles, from whom these badges were acquired, was a key figure in the London underground scene in the 1960s. He was a founder of the Indica Bookshop, the underground newspaper 'International Times' and was involved in the setting up of the UFO, an all night club originally set up to provide funds for the 'International Times'. This body of material came into his collection because of his involvement in these activities in the 1960s.   circular printed lapel badge   \n",

Most actors and actresses had studio photographs taken, in everyday dress or theatrical costume, for ‘cartes de visite’, and later ‘cabinet cards’.  Both were albumen prints made from glass negatives, attached to stiff card backing printed with the photographer’s name. _x000D_ _x000D_ ‘Cartes de visite’, the size of  formal visiting cards, were patented in 1854 and produced in their millions during the 1860s when it became fashionable to collect them. Their subjects included scenic views, tourist attractions and works of art, as well as portraits. They were superseded in the late 1870s by the larger and sturdier ‘cabinet cards’ whose popularity waned in turn during the 1890s in favour of postcards and studio portraits._x000D_  _x000D_ This photograph comes from a large collection of ‘cartes de visite’ and ‘cabinet cards’ removed from their backings and mounted in albums by Guy Tristram Little (d.1953) who bequeathed them to the V&A.  A collector of greetings cards, games and photographs, Guy Little was a partner in the legal firm Messrs Milles Jennings White & Foster, and the solicitor and executor of Mrs. Gabrielle Enthoven, whose theatrical collection formed the basis of the Theatre Collections at the V&A.

In 1935 his son Charles Goldsmith entered the firm with the aim of making glasses a fashion item. From the company's offices in Poland Street, his sons A. Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company's reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, the actress Diana Dors, Princess Grace of Monaco and Diana, Princess of Wales._x000D_ _x000D_ A. Oliver Goldsmith created this frame in 1965. Imitation tortoiseshell became very popular at this time. As an alternative to real tortoiseshell (which by the late 1960s became scarce, expensive and then illegal to buy and sell) plastic imitation tortoiseshell quickly became a style statement.   Imitation tortoiseshell plastic sunglasses with deep squared frames and round eye-shaped lenses.   \n",

Michael Annals (1938-1990) trained at Hornsey College of Art and began his career designing sets and costumes for the Old Vic. In 1963 the newly formed National Theatre Company moved into the Old Vic and Annals joined them, having his first major success with his designs for Peter Shaffer's historical epic, <i>The Royal Hunt of the Sun</i> (1964). He went on to have an international career, designing for the theatre and for ballet, opera and film, but is most closely associated with the National Theatre, where he created notable settings for a range of productions, including O'Neill's <i>Long Day's Journey into Night</i> starring Laurence Olivier, Hecht and MacArthur's <i>The Front Page</i> and Shaw's <i>Heartbreak House</i>. Annals frequently worked in the United States and was Associate Professor of Scenic Design at Yale in 1966-1967. In 1984 he gave up the stage and took up photography and illustration.

       "8452   Costume design by Percy Anderson for Bouncer in <i>Cox and Box,</i> Princes Theatre, 1921.  <i>Cox and Box</i>, or, <i>The Long Lost Brothers</i> by Francis Burnand and Arthur Sullivan was first performed at Moray Lodge, Campden Hill, on Saturday 26 May 1866._x000D_ _x000D_ This one-act opera was conceived for one of Arthur Lewis’s <i>Moray Minstrels’</i> parties given at his Kensington home four Saturdays a year– all-male affairs before his marriage in 1867, with glee-singing, oysters at 11pm, an entertainment, and copious drinking and smoking. Guests included some of London’s most influential creative men including Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Dante Gabriel Rosetti, Edwin Landseer, George Du Maurier, Frederick Leighton, and Frederick Walker, who designed Lewis’s engraved invitation card from 1865 to 1871._x000D_ _x000D_ Following Offenbach’s <i>Les Deux Aveugles</i> at a previous event, Burnand suggested that he and the 24-year old Sullivan set John Maddison Morton’s 1847 farce <i>Box and Cox</i> as an operetta. With its plot concerning a hatter and a printer who unbeknown to each other occupy the same room in lodgings due to their working hours, it was repeated at Moray House on 27th April 1867, and with Sullivan’s orchestration for benefits at the Adelphi Theatre on 11th May 1867, and at Manchester Theatre Royal on 29th July 1867. It had its first professional run at London’s Royal Gallery of Illustration from 29th March 1869, and featured in the D’Oyly Carte repertoire after its inclusion at the Savoy Theatre on 31st December 1894._x000D_  The artist and costume designer Percy Anderson (1851-1928) was based in London where he exhibited watercolours at the New Water Colour Society in 1886. He designed costumes for the original productions of the last four Gilbert and Sullivan operas at the Savoy Theatre - <i>The Yeomen of the Guard</i> (1888), <i>The Gondoliers</i> (1889), <i>Utopia, Limited</i> (1893), and <i>The Grand Duke</i> (1896), and for several D’Oyly Carte revivals including that for <i>Utopia, Limited</i> considered by Rupert D’Oyly Carte in 1926  and but never realised. Given Gilbert’s exacting attitude to his productions it is an accolade to Anderson that he worked with Gilbert on so many, including Gilbert and Edward German’s <i>Fallen Fairies</i> (1909), when Gilbert said Anderson: ‘surpassed himself’._x000D_ _x000D_ Anderson designed costumes for many other notable late 19th century productions including several by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty’s Theatre, and musical comedies produced by George Edwardes at Daly’s Theatre such as <i>San Toy</i> (1899) and <i>The Duchess of Dantzig</i> (1903). Among his other successes were costumes for Oscar Ashe’s spectacular productions <i>Kismet</i> (1911), <i>Chu Chin Chow</i> (1916), and <i>Cairo</i> (1921).

Their subjects included scenic views, tourist attractions and works of art, as well as portraits. They were superseded in the late 1870s by the larger and sturdier ‘cabinet cards’ whose popularity waned in turn during the 1890s in favour of postcards and studio portraits._x000D_  _x000D_ This photograph comes from a large collection of ‘cartes de visite’ and ‘cabinet cards’ removed from their backings and mounted in albums by Guy Tristram Little (d.1953) who bequeathed them to the V&A.

His father, also called John Russell (1711–1804), was a bookseller, printseller and amateur artist. Russell was educated at Guildford grammar school and won premiums from the Society of Artists for drawings in 1759 and 1760. He was apprenticed to Francis Cotes and set up his own practice in 1767. In 1770 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, London, winning the silver medal for figure drawing. He exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1768 and annually at the Royal Academy from 1769 to 1806. He was elected ARA in 1772 and RA in 1788, when he became Crayon Painter to King George III and to George, Prince of Wales. He painted some rather stilted portraits in oil, but most of his work—hundreds of portraits and large numbers of fancy pictures of children with animals—is in pastel. His pastel portraits include Dr Robert Willis (c. 1790; Hove, Mus. & A.G.). He had a large and fashionable clientele._x000D_ _x000D_ In his excellent and detailed Elements of Painting with Crayons, Russell purported to explain the technique of his master, Francis Cotes, but his own work is far more effective with its brilliant use of reds, blues and yellows laid in on blue paper. Russell achieved a distinctive blurred effect by smudging the outlines with the finger and crayon, a technique he combined with striking finishing details in black. Russell was also an astronomer and produced oil and watercolour studies of the moon._x000D_ Geoffrey Ashton, 'Russell, John', Grove Art Online. , 12/07/2005,   \n",

Around 1769 his two sons Richard I (1734-1811) and Robert II (1745-95) joined the business, and showrooms were set up in London. These became the main retailing offices. They attracted more customers than those in Lancaster and helped the company  to keep up with the newest fashions. Furniture production was based in Lancaster, and travelling salesmen toured the country taking orders.The company produced a wide range of high quality furniture. Some was designed by the fashionable contemporary architect James Wyatt; other designs were based on pattern books by cabinet-makers such as George Hepplewhite and Thomas Sheraton. Gillow invented the davenport (an upright desk on castors) and the 'Imperial Extending Dining table'.<br><br>Also known as<br>Gillow & Co.Gillow & SonGillows of Lancaster   \n",

He was the son of a tailor in Antwerp and trained as an engraver with Gaspar Huybrechts (1619–84) and Cornelis Galle the younger. On arriving in Paris in 1666, he worked with his compatriot Nicolas Pitau the elder, and then with François de Poilly, Robert Nanteuil and Philippe de Champaigne. In 1672 he married the daughter of Nicolas Regnesson, the Parisian engraver and print publisher, thus himself becoming a print publisher. In 1675 he became a naturalized Frenchman and in 1677 was admitted (reçu) to the Académie Royale. In 1695 he was made a Chevalier of the Order of St Michel and a Papal Knight. He became both a councillor at the Académie and Premier Dessinateur du Cabinet du Roi. Among his pupils were his brother Jean Edelinck (b Antwerp, c. 1643; d Paris, 14 May 1680), his godson Nicolas Pitau the younger and Jacques Lubin (c. 1659–after 1703). Edelinck specialized in portraits, which make up two-thirds of his work; he was a reproductive engraver, who translated the works of the most important portraitists of his time, such as Hyacinthe Rigaud (e.g. Charles Colbert, Marquis de Croissy, 1691; see Weigert, no. 121) and Nicolas de Largillierre (e.g. Charles Gobinet, 1691, w 123), and is considered as one of the century’s greatest engravers._x000D_ _x000D_ Gérard Edelinck’s brother Jean Edelinck came to Paris at about the same time as he, and likewise became an engraver, print publisher and print-seller. He made engravings of seven statues from the grotto and gardens of Versailles for the Cabinet du Roi and engraved some portraits, as well as reproducing a good many compositions by Henri Wattelé. Jean Edelinck’s early death prevented him from fully exploiting his talent. Another brother, Gaspard-François Edelinck (b Antwerp, 18 Nov 1652; d Paris, 21 May 1722), was also an engraver. He joined his brothers in Paris, where he seems to have worked mainly in collaboration with Gérard; but c. 20 pieces bearing his signature are known. Nicolas-Etienne Edelinck (b Paris, 9 April 1681; d Paris, 11 May 1767), the eighth son of Gérard Edelinck, also became an engraver; he travelled to Munich, Venice and Rome. His oeuvre, all of it reproductive, numbers only c. 30 prints, mostly portraits, such as that of Gérard Edelinck (1707; see Roux, no. 2) after François Tortebat (c. 1621–90). He also produced some vignettes for books.   \n",

Manuel was a constantly-confused waiter whose limited English skills led to many of the show’s comedic moments. Written by and starring John Cleese and Connie Booth, Fawlty Towers follows the fiascos of reluctant hotel manager Basil Fawlty, his strong-willed wife Sybil, confused waiter Manuel and maid Polly. The show became one of the most iconic and celebrated British comedy shows, winning three BAFTAs and two nominations including one for Sachs’ performance.

As a child he shared his sister's passions for drawing and natural history and it was he who first encouraged Beatrix to publish some early rabbit drawings as greetings cards in 1890.  _x000D_ _x000D_ Bertram's work informed that of his sister. On 25 July 1905 Beatrix Potter wrote to Frederick Warne & Co. to suggest the cause of some 'spottyness' on the printing blocks of her book illustrations: 'I have seen my brother's copperplate etchings go exactly the same way, especially if using a mixture of hydrochloric & nitric acid. I think H.Cl. feels the heat most & they split'.  Beatrix later based several of her illustrations to The Fairy Caravan (1929) on Bertram's etchings of rocky Lake District landscapes.  _x000D_ _x000D_ Although overshadowed by the success of his sister, Bertram became an artist in his own right. He produced much larger scale oil paintings and etchings and exhibited work at the Royal Academy.      THES48864 - Unique   \n",

The mixture of comedy sketches and song was popular with holiday makers and the Fol-de-Rols became a regular summer feature. After World War I their producer, George Royle, went into partnership with Greatrex (Rex) Newman, staging Fol-de-Rols shows in Hastings, Westcliff-on-Sea, Eastbourne, Sandown and Llandudno. Royle retired in 1935 but Newman continued to present the shows, for which he wrote much of the material. During World War II the Fol-de-Rols company entertained the troops as part of ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association) and the popularity of the seaside shows continued throughout the 1940s and 50s, with a winter tour being added.  In 1960 Newman sold the Fol-de-Rols to impresarios Jack Hylton and Hugh Charles. Charles took over the running of the shows and continued to present summer seasons and winter tours. Newman still wrote for them, providing topical material and lyrics, but, as the 1960s progressed, the Fol-de-Rols found themselves competing with other forms of entertainment. The last big seaside show was staged in 1968, though there was a tour in 1969 and attempts were made to revive the shows on a smaller scale in the 1970s._x000D_ _x000D_ In their heydays in the 1950s and early 1960s the Fol-de-Rols employed many of the major names in light entertainment. New costumes and scenery were created for each season by leading designers, including Alec Shanks and St John Roper. This design is one of a collection of preliminary designs and artwork for Fol-de-Rols scenery which was made for the scene painters, Alick Johnstone Ltd. Alick Johnstone ran a highly successful workshop, founded in 1921, which created the scenery for the majority of West End and touring shows for over 50 years._x000D_  This pencil design of a chicken run was used for the centre set piece of a scene entitled 'Chicken Ballet' and featured in the Fol-de-Rols revue at the Theatre Royal Brighton in 1960.

The band toured the US with Jimi Hendrix and Arthur Brown was notable for his theatrics, including setting a specially made helmet on fire, and stripping off naked on stage.

Along with the motifs created by Armand-Albert Rateau, Jeanne Lanvin's decorator and partner, Lanvin created a distinctive image which remains to this day._x000D_ _x000D_ Jeanne Lanvin's successors include Antonio del Castillo, Dominique Morlotti, Jules-François Crahay, Maryll Lanvin, Claude Montana and Patrick Lavoix.

This one, however, was made for a presentation in 1904, the year before Irving's death. It is dedicated and dated in the bronze in Irving's writing: 'With every good wish to Geoffrey, Henry Irving'. It is one of several plaques, medallions and sculptures featuring Irving that were made during his lifetime and after his death. _x000D_ _x000D_ Irving dedicated his life to the theatre. After fifteen years acting in repertory from 1856 until 1871, he made his name at the Lyceum Theatre in the melodrama <i>The Bells</i>. For the next thirty-one years Irving starred at the Lyceum, holding audiences spellbound and setting new standards of production and performance that made his name legendary. He was the first actor ever to be granted a Knighthood, in 1895 and his death was a cause for national mourning.   Roughly circular bronze plaque cast with a head and shoulders portrait of Sir Henry Irving, profile to right, bare-headed, wearing a jacket with the left lapel visible, a large tie, waistcoat and stand-up collar.  HENRY IRVING is incised in the metal above his head.

In 1882 he set up his own architecture practice and from the late 1880s started to design repeating patterns for wallpaper, woven and printed textiles and carpets. _x000D_ _x000D_ Voysey's most interesting designs date from this time and show the influence of William Morris's principles of pattern design and use of plant forms and animals as standard motifs. Voysey's textiles are dominated by flowing patterns incorporating birds, deer, hearts, flowers and trees in silhouette. He sold his work to manufacturers such as G. P. & J. Baker, Thomas Wardle and Alexander Morton, and many of his designs were sold through Liberty in London. Voysey's work was well known in continental Europe, and though popular with French Art Nouveau designers, his influence was felt more dramatically by the founders of the Modern movement.

During childhood, he travelled with them to America and then back to Britain, to settle in Buxton, Derbyshire. There his father died leaving his mother in poverty. In 1876, he contributed comic drawings to The Buxton Journal and Looker-On, which reappeared a year or two later in Pen & Ink Sketches of Scenes & Incidents in Buxton, a volume published in Manchester._x000D_ Baxter moved to Manchester to take up an apprenticeship with Alfred Darbyshire, an architect best known for building theatres, who was also active as an actor-manager.  The publisher, John Andrew Christie, hired him in 1877 to draw all the cartoons for Comus, a new satirical weekly.  He worked on its follow-up, 'Momus'. In 1882, Baxter left Manchester for London (his departure leading to the demise of 'Momus')._x000D_ Baxter used his meticulous draughtsmanship to vitalise Charles Ross’s creation, ‘Ally Sloper’ in the pages of 'Judy'._x000D_ he died of consumption in St Pancras, London, on 2 June 1888, in only his 32nd year.   \n",

She.started her remarkable collection in the 1890s, in her flat in Cadogan Gardens. As her collection grew she came to the realisation that London was the only European capital without a public collection of theatrical records, and that an institution was needed to take it on as a gift to ensure its future. In 1911 she wrote to The Observer pointing out the need for a central repository of theatrical material that could be generally accessible, suggesting: ‘a comprehensive theatrical section in an existing museum to comprise specimens of all the different branches necessary to the workings of a play from the construction of the theatre, the designing of the scenery and costumes, to the smallest workings necessary in the house. Also a library and a collection of playbills, prints, pictures and relics etc.’_x000D_ _x000D_ After the initial refusal from the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum Cecil Harcourt-Smith to accept her material, Mrs Enthoven remained undeterred; and after the successful and influential International Theatre Exhibition of around 900 theatre designs, brought over from Amsterdam in 1922 and staged at the V&A, Mrs Enthoven renewed her efforts to get the museum to accept her collection and in March 1924 she succeeded.   \n",

There were three elder daughters, Elizabeth, Janet, and Robina. In 1768 when Murray established himself in business at London he dropped the prefix ‘Mc’ from his name. He matriculated at Edinburgh University for one term in 1752. In the following year he began a career in the marines that led to a commission in July 1762. Little is known of his service during the Seven Years' War, after which he retired on half pay. On 3 March 1763 he married, at Chatham, Nancy (bap. 1745, d. 1776), daughter of Captain William Weemss and Ann Weber of Brompton, near Chatham. There were no children from the marriage._x000D_ _x000D_ Murray's search for gainful employment separated him from his wife and brought him to the north of Scotland to work on the Gordonstoun estate and afterwards to Edinburgh, where job opportunities eluded him. He occupied himself in writing a short novel, ‘The History of Sir Launcelot Edgevile’, published in the Court Miscellany, and a pamphlet on the Edinburgh theatre, but realized that he lacked the talent to pursue a literary career with any chance of success. In the spring of 1766 he returned to England and reluctantly was reinstated in the marines at Chatham._x000D_ _x000D_ In October 1768 Murray learned that the well-established London bookselling business of William Sandby at 32 Fleet Street could be bought for £1000. With £700, the sum of his wife's dowry, and the additional funds borrowed from friends, he ventured upon a career about which he knew little or nothing. To the poet William Falconer, who declined to be a partner, he remarked: ‘Many blockheads in the trade are making fortunes’ (Murray letter-book, 16 Oct 1768). Murray's first publication was the fifth edition of Lyttelton's Dialogues of the Dead, a title Sandby had first published in 1760. From his bookshop Murray also sold stationery, and at different times dealt in medicines, lottery tickets, Irish linen, Tassie's gems, beer, wine, and game birds._x000D_ _x000D_ The House of Lords decision of 1774 on literary property enabled Murray to exploit the market for reprinting. He produced inexpensive editions of the poems of Thomas Gray in 1776 and James Thomson in 1778, both enhanced with illustrations and critical assessments. He also bought into such large-scale ventures as the Works of the English Poets, edited by Samuel Johnson. A legal dispute in 1777 with the Revd William Mason over the copyright in three short poems in the Gray edition led Murray to defend himself in public with A Letter to W.

She.started her remarkable collection in the 1890s, in her flat in Cadogan Gardens. As her collection grew she came to the realisation that London was the only European capital without a public collection of theatrical records, and that an institution was needed to take it on as a gift to ensure its future. In 1911 she wrote to The Observer pointing out the need for a central repository of theatrical material that could be generally accessible, suggesting: ‘a comprehensive theatrical section in an existing museum to comprise specimens of all the different branches necessary to the workings of a play from the construction of the theatre, the designing of the scenery and costumes, to the smallest workings necessary in the house. Also a library and a collection of playbills, prints, pictures and relics etc.’_x000D_ _x000D_ After the initial refusal from the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum Cecil Harcourt-Smith to accept her material, Mrs Enthoven remained undeterred; and after the successful and influential International Theatre Exhibition of around 900 theatre designs, brought over from Amsterdam in 1922 and staged at the V&A, Mrs Enthoven renewed her efforts to get the museum to accept her collection and in March 1924 she succeeded.   \n",

It is however known that the painter John Tobias Young, who sometimes liked to be known as Tobias Young, lived at 1 Hanover Buildings, Southampton and died there in 1824 at the age of 69. It has been said that he was probably born in Mildenhall near Marlborough. This same artist is recorded as having painted the scenery for Lord Barrymore's theatre at Wargrave from 1788-92. His obituary mentioned his painting of the Judgement of Solomon dated 1810, presented to the City of Southampton although he is best known as a landscape painter. Several views of Southampton and the surrounding countryside are known to be by him. There seems no question that the artists called John or Tobias Young were related. Tobias and John Young shared the same Southampton address in 1811, roughly when John Young moved to Jersey.   \n",

He was born of peasants Jean and Anne (or Idatte) Gellée in the village of Champagne, then in the independent duchy of Lorraine. Due to an inaccurate inscription, his birth date was long believed to be 1600, but it is now believed to be 1604. His early training is uncertain, but it seems as if he went to Rome at age 13 or so, perhaps as a pastry cook, and then probably went to Naples, where he studied painting. He was highly regarded as an artist. His landscapes depict an image of nature more beautiful and better ordered than nature itself, often including pastoral scenes with shepherds guarding their flocks. He refined the theme, first seen in Venetian painting around 1510, by using light as the principal means both of unifying the composition and of lending beauty to the landscape. His popular works embodied the courtly values of 'high finish' and decorum; among his most important patrons were members of the European nobility and higher clergy.   \n",

A rival of the Gaiety, it  became the home of musical comedy after Edwardes began staging  musicals there in 1894.

The Academy was granted a royal charter in 1838 and from thenceforth has been known as the Royal Scottish Academy. (rsa)_x000D_ In 1850 Prince Albert laid the foundation stone of a new building on The Mound in Edinburgh, which was to house the newly formed National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy. The RSA first held its Annual Exhibition in its new galleries on the eastern side of the building in 1855 and these continued here until 1910. The RSA also had its Council Room, Library and Life School in this building._x000D_ In 1910 the Academy moved to new premises in an adjacent building, previously called the Royal Institution. (In return for being given a new home the Academy gifted 96 paintings and sculptures and about 2,000 drawings to the National Gallery of Scotland.)

She.started her remarkable collection in the 1890s, in her flat in Cadogan Gardens. As her collection grew she came to the realisation that London was the only European capital without a public collection of theatrical records, and that an institution was needed to take it on as a gift to ensure its future. In 1911 she wrote to The Observer pointing out the need for a central repository of theatrical material that could be generally accessible, suggesting: ‘a comprehensive theatrical section in an existing museum to comprise specimens of all the different branches necessary to the workings of a play from the construction of the theatre, the designing of the scenery and costumes, to the smallest workings necessary in the house. Also a library and a collection of playbills, prints, pictures and relics etc.’_x000D_ _x000D_ After the initial refusal from the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum Cecil Harcourt-Smith to accept her material, Mrs Enthoven remained undeterred; and after the successful and influential International Theatre Exhibition of around 900 theatre designs, brought over from Amsterdam in 1922 and staged at the V&A, Mrs Enthoven renewed her efforts to get the museum to accept her collection and in March 1924 she succeeded.   \n",

Around 1769 his two sons Richard I (1734-1811) and Robert II (1745-95) joined the business, and showrooms were set up in London. These became the main retailing offices. They attracted more customers than those in Lancaster and helped the company  to keep up with the newest fashions. Furniture production was based in Lancaster, and travelling salesmen toured the country taking orders.The company produced a wide range of high quality furniture. Some was designed by the fashionable contemporary architect James Wyatt; other designs were based on pattern books by cabinet-makers such as George Hepplewhite and Thomas Sheraton. Gillow invented the davenport (an upright desk on castors) and the 'Imperial Extending Dining table'._x000D_ _x000D_ _x000D_ The leading firm of English c18-c19 cabinet-makers outside London. It was founded by a joiner, Robert Gillow (1703-1772), in or shortly after 1727 in Lancaster. He took his eldest son Richard into partnership in 1757; another son, Robert, went to London in 1776 to run a showroom and warehouse which had been built c. 1765 on the site occupied by their successors, Waring & Gillow in Oxford Street until 1974 (though no member of the family has been connected with the firm since 1817). Their main factory remained in Lancaster and they were much patronized by northern and Scottish gentry, e.g. Duke of Atholl, Earls of Strafford and Derby. They were Roman Catholics and were patronized by their co-religionists, but they undertook extensive commissions in the south, e.g. furnishing Mrs Piozzi's house at Streatham in 1784. And they carried on a lively export trade to the Baltic and the West indies. In the 1760s they began to stamp some pieces of their case furniture, being the first English firm to adopt this practice. They are best known for handsome, well-made but relatively simple furniture in the late Georgian and Regency styles. In the c19 they emplyed several of the leading designer, e.g. T.E. Collcutt and B.J. Talbert. They absorbed Collinson & Lock in 1897 and amalgamated with S.J. Waring & Son shortly afterwards. In the 1930s they employed Serge Chermayeff an P.

He trained in Antwerp under his godfather Nicolaes Lauwers and around 1656 moved to Paris, where he made prints after Philippe de Champaigne and for the Flemish publishers Herman Weyen (d 1672) and Jacques van Merle. From 1666 he published the first work produced in Paris by his young compatriot Gérard Edelinck. Pitau was an excellent engraver, who could at times rival Robert Nanteuil in the reproduction of portraits; he died before he had fully developed his talent. He executed c. 80 works, mostly after Philippe de Champaigne and Jean-Baptiste de Champaigne, Laurent de La Hyre and Claude Lefèbvre. His son, Nicolas Pitau the younger (bapt Paris, 4 June 1670; bur Paris, 16 Feb 1724), was a French engraver; Gérard Edelinck was his godfather and teacher. Although Pitau was undoubtedly talented, he allowed his work to decline into facility and mediocrity.   \n",

He was the younger brother of the children's author and illustrator Beatrix Potter and shared his sister's passions for drawing and natural history.  While Beatrix was educated at home, Bertram was sent to boarding school at The Grange in Eastbourne and matriculated at Magdalen College Oxford in 1890 to read classics.  He became a member of The Athenaeum in April 1906.   _x000D_ _x000D_ On 20 November 1902 Bertram eloped with Mary Welsh Scott, the daughter of a wine merchant in Hawick.  They were married in Edinburgh and lived in Throsk House, Stirling until 1903 when they bought Ashyburn, a working farm near the village of Ancrum on the Scottish borders.  The couple kept their marriage a secret for 11 years during which Bertram continued to join his family for summer holidays and made occasional visits home to 2 Bolton Gardens, London.  He died suddenly in 1918 of a cerebral haemorrhage._x000D_ _x000D_ An artist in his own right, Bertram worked on a larger scale than Beatrix. His oil paintings of landscapes in the Lake District and Scotland may be seen at Beatrix's former home, Hill Top in Near Sawrey, and at the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Bertram also became proficient in copper-plate etching and exhibited work at the Royal Academy._x000D_ _x000D_ Source: Lear, Linda. Beatrix Potter: a life in nature (London: Allen Lane, 2007).   \n",

He early created a great impression on audiences, partnering the established and younger dancers of the company, including Kschessinska, Preobrajenska, Pavlova and Karsavina.  Soon after graduating, he met Diaghilev who was to be the most important influence on his life and he appeared with the dancers organised by Diaghilev in Paris in 1909, creating a sensation.  The choreographer Michel Fokine created roles for him that emphasised his extraordinary animalistic sexual qualities, such as the Favourite Slave in Scheherazade, his soft poetic lyricism, such as the Poet in Les Sylphides, a mocking humour in Harlequin in Carnaval.  In 1911 he was dismissed from the Imperial Theatres, whether by accident or design, and joined the now permanent company that Diaghilev built around him.  That year saw two of his most famous roles, Le Spectre de la rose and the title role in Petrushka.  In 1912 Diaghilev encouraged him to choreograph, and he produced L'Apres midi d'un faune, the suggestive last movements of which created a satisfying scandal, and followed this with the even more sensational failure Le Sacre du Printemps in 1913.   His association with Diaghilev came to an abrupt end when he married Romola de Pulsky on the 1913 American tour, although he did appear with the Company on its American tour in 1916.  He subsequently settled in Switzerland, but showed increasing signs of instability and he spent the remainder of his life in various institutions and undergoing various treatments.  _x000D_ He was the greatest male dancer of his generation who revolutionised the public perception of the male dancer.  He had amazing elevation and ballon but allied his formidable technique to the expressive qualities of the roles, in which he immersed himself to an almost disturbing degree.   \n",

A rival of the Gaiety, it  became the home of musical comedy after Edwardes began staging  musicals there in 1894.

Free, 4 April 1759.  Having regard to the status of Kandler and Archambo this may well indicate a turn over of the apprentice to a member of the Goldsmiths' Company for his freedom, since the former was apparently not free of the Company.  The entry of the mark as largeworker, 12 October 1757 (Adress: South side of St James's Market) provides further doubts.  Firstly it is eighteen months earler than the freedom of William Reynolds, although if he was the same apprentice as Kandler in 1748, he had already nine years at the craft and was obviously competent to work.  But there is another problem.  The name can be read, as Chaffers did, as \"Reynoldson\" or, as seems more possible, \"Reynolds on / South side of St. James Market\".  The latter seems supported by the fact that the Parliamentary Report list 1773 has only William Reynolds, plate worker, Swallow Street, St James's.  Since Archambo and Kandler worked respectively in Coventry Street, and Jermyn Street the likelihood of a pupil remaining in the same general area seems strong and suggests identity between him of St. James's Market in 1757 and Swallow Street in 1773.

In 1890 she opened a millinery shop in Paris. During the early years of the 20th century the clothes she made for her younger sister and later for her small daughter attracted so much attention from customers that Lanvin created copies and introduced new lines to sell in her store. Over the following years demand by young women persuaded Lanvin to open a couture house selling matching mother-and-daughter garments. _x000D_ _x000D_ Shortly before World War I she created her famous 'robes de style', based on 18th-century designs. These waisted, full-skirted dresses remained popular until the early 1920s with only slight adjustments. She also designed romantic 'picture' dresses based on softened Victorian shapes and lavishly trimmed with embroidery. Influenced by orientalism from around 1910, Lanvin turned to exotic eveningwear in Eastern-style velvets and satins. _x000D_ _x000D_ At the beginning of World War I she made a simple chemise dress which later became the basic outline for the 1920s. Lanvin's postwar clothes were in the spirit of the age. In 1921 a Riviera collection introduced Aztec embroideries. The following year the Lanvin Breton suit appeared, comprising a gently gathered skirt, a short, braided jacket with lots of small buttons, and a big white organdie collar turning down over a red satin bow. A sailor hat or round straw hat topped the outfit. Lanvin also sold beaded dance dresses, a wool jersey sportsdress patterned in check of gold and silver thread, dinner pyjamas and capes. Her work was easily recognisable by her skilful use of embroidery and her fine craftsmanship. She used a particular shade of blue so often that it came to be called 'Lanvin blue'. _x000D_ _x000D_ Callan, Georgina O'Hara. <font -i>The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Fashion and Fashion Designers</font -i>.

       "9986   Born in Keinton, Somerset in 1838, Irving was educated in London at the City Commercial School, off Lombard Street.  In 1856, aged 18, and after spending four yearsworking  in a Newdigate Street counting house, he made his first stage appearance at the Lyceum Theatre, Sunderland, chosing an acting career against his Methodist mother’s wishes. _x000D_ _x000D_ For the next nine years he appeared with various provincial Stock companies, playing during the following ten years over 600 parts. By 1866 he was established in London when Dion Bouccicault offered him the part of Rawdon Scudamore in his play Hunted Down at the St. James's Theatre, but it was to be another five years before he found overnight fame at the Lyceum Theatre playing the Polish Jew in an adaptation by Leopold Lewis of Erckmann-Chatrian's Le Juif Polonais, re-titled The Bells._x000D_ _x000D_ For the next thirty years Henry Irving was to be at the centre of Victorian Society, and in 1895 he became the first actor to be knighted for his achievements._x000D_ _x000D_ Irving was also a man of letters with honorary doctorates from Cambridge, Dublin and Glasgow Universities. He became a mason and was a close associate of leading politicians and the monarchy._x000D_ _x000D_ As a master of mise-en-scène he was at the forefront in the development of gaslight for his spectacular productions of Shakespeare and romantic melodrama at the Royal Lyceum Theatre, London between 1871 and 1902 and was sole manager of that theatre from 1878 to 1899. During this period and until 1902 Ellen Terry was his leading lady. _x000D_ _x000D_ In 1904 the interior of Irving’s theatre had to be demolished because it did not comply with new safety regulations.

He regularly took his productions to the major cities in the UK. In 1904 Irving started on a series of Farewell Tours with plans to retire in 1906, after celebrating fifty years on the stage.

Their subjects included scenic views, tourist attractions and works of art, as well as portraits. They were superseded in the late 1870s by the larger and sturdier ‘cabinet cards’ whose popularity waned in turn during the 1890s in favour of postcards and studio portraits._x000D_  _x000D_ This photograph comes from a large collection of ‘cartes de visite’ and ‘cabinet cards’ removed from their backings and mounted in albums by Guy Tristram Little (d.1953) who bequeathed them to the V&amp;A.

Most actors and actresses had studio photographs taken, in everyday dress or theatrical costume, for ‘cartes de visite’, and later ‘cabinet cards’.  Both were albumen prints made from glass negatives, attached to stiff card backing printed with the photographer’s name. _x000D_ _x000D_ ‘Cartes de visite’, the size of  formal visiting cards, were patented in 1854 and produced in their millions during the 1860s when it became fashionable to collect them. Their subjects included scenic views, tourist attractions and works of art, as well as portraits. They were superseded in the late 1870s by the larger and sturdier ‘cabinet cards’ whose popularity waned in turn during the 1890s in favour of postcards and studio portraits._x000D_  _x000D_ This photograph comes from a large collection of ‘cartes de visite’ and ‘cabinet cards’ removed from their backings and mounted in albums by Guy Tristram Little (d.1953) who bequeathed them to the V&A.  A collector of greetings cards, games and photographs, Guy Little was a partner in the legal firm Messrs Milles Jennings White & Foster, and the solicitor and executor of Mrs. Gabrielle Enthoven, whose theatrical collection formed the basis of the Theatre Collections at the V&A.

Record contracts and television shows made him a household name by the end of the 1950's. His fans affectionately called him Mr. Heart-Throb. He made a brave decision early in the 1960's to switch to singing in operas. The end of the 1960’s established David in the opera world. He performed at Glyndebourne and worked with the Welsh and English National Opera Companies.   \n",
