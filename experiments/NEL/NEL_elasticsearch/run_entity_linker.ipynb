       "    'description': \"E. Bennion, 'Antique Medical Instruments', (University of California Press, 1979), p.337 ;    John Weiss & Son were London-based surgical instrument makers, founded in 1787 by John Weiss, upon his move to London from Germany. Originally trained as a cutler, as was his father and great grandfather, Weiss quickly moved into the manufacture of surgical instruments. In 1831, Frederick Foveaux Weiss joined his father firm, henceforth known as ‘John Weiss & Son’ taking over completely on his father’s death on Christmas Day 1843. The quality and reliability of John Weiss instruments lead to them becoming the supplier of choice to the British Army with the result that John Weiss instruments travelled all around the globe.  Under William IV, Weiss was appointed 'Razor Maker to the King’.  John Weiss was extremely proud of his royal appointment and featured the royal arms in a trademark on the pressed horn handles of his surgical instruments.  The introduction of the modern hospital at the end of the 19th century with the demand for sterilisable all-steel instruments, changed the face of the surgical instrument market. It was no longer necessary for each surgeon to possess a complete set of instruments of his own.  In many cases the manufacture of instruments by hand was replaced by industrial production methods. Numerous small firms ceased to exist but John Weiss & Son developed, expanded and eventually moved from premises at 62 Strand to 287 Oxford Street. On 3rd July 1899 it was made into a limited company with shareholders.  The company was acquired by Clement Clarke in 1971 and together they became part of the Haag-Streit group in 1989.   1787-established as John Weiss, cutler located at 42 Strand; 1811-John Weiss, cutler, 33 Strand; 1823- John Weiss, cultler, 62 Strand, London; 1830 - John Weiss & Son, 62 Strand; 1883 John Weiss & Sons, 62 Strand and 287 Oxford Street; 1889 - J. Weiss & Sons, 287 Oxford Street; 1894 - J. Weiss & Sons, 287 Oxford Street  (formerly 62 Strand); 1979 17 Wigmore Street; pre-2007 part of Haag-Streit Group of manufacturing companies and specialising in ophthalmic instruments, name changed John Weiss & Son Limited, and business located at John Weiss & Son Ltd.\",\n",

Oxford Reference Online. .   14 April 2008  <; ;       The German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz made important discoveries in fields as diverse as physics and physiology. Applying his knowledge of physics to his medical research, Helmholtz showed that living beings obey the same physical laws as other objects. Some physiologists had believed that living bodies were special because they contained a ‘vital force’. Helmholtz disproved the existence of this force.  Helmholtz made significant contributions to several widely varied areas of modern science. In physiology and physiological psychology, he is known for his mathematics of the eye, theories of vision, ideas on the visual perception of space, color vision research, and on the sensation of tone, perception of sound, and empiricism.   In physics, he is known for his theories on the conservation of energy (1847), work in electrodynamics, chemical thermodynamics, and on a mechanical foundation of thermodynamics. As a philosopher, he is known for his philosophy of science, ideas on the relation between the laws of perception and the laws of nature, the science of aesthetics, and ideas on the civilizing power of science.  Helmholtz was also important for medical research because he invented many new instruments to observe and measure the body, such as the ophthalmoscope. He used these instruments to investigate how the senses work - a question that fascinated him throughout his career. His research contributed, for example, to our understanding of how we see colour, and how we hear music.',\n",

When at rest, the galvanometer needle and coils are parallel to each other and to the Earth's magnetic field. When current flows, the needle deflects, and the amount of current flowing is exactly proportional to the trigonometric tangent of the angle through which the needle has turned.\",\n",

One paid an extra subscription and when wanting to hear a play or a concert, one asked to be connected to the Electrophone switchboard at the exchange and asked for the desired concert. The table had connexions for up to six headsets. The idea originated in France but was adopted by the National Telephone Company in the early 1900s (hence the ‘NT’ initials on the underside of the table.) Service ceased in London in about 1925 but lingered on in Bournemouth until the mid-1930s.',\n",

The LNER was the second biggest of the the 'Big Four' railway companies formed during grouping.  The group consisted of seven constituent and 26 subsidiary companies. The constituents were North Eastern, Great Northern, Great Eastern, Great Central, Hull & Barnsley, North British and Great North of Scotland. As the name suggests the company covered the arc of the country between north and east of London and included the East Coast Mainline. The main workshops for the company were in Doncaster. // Birth Place: Leeds, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, United Kingdom.\",\n",

After almost 200 years they started to build bodies for cars, famously getting approval from C S Rolls in 1905.   Barkers had showrooms at 66-69 South Audley Street in Mayfair and in 1926 had a factory at Olaf Sreet, Shepherd's Bush. They were associated with Rolls-Royce from the very beginning, being C. S. Rolls & Co. preferred coachbuilder. Rolls-Royce experimental cars generally moved away from Barkers to Park Ward in the early 1930s largely because any needs for greater strength in a Barker body seemed to be solved by making it heavier.  Hoopers took over Barker & Co. at liquidation in 1938 and built another factory at Elveden Road, Willesden, not far from the Park Royal works, for Barker coachwork, but only completed 9 bodies before the outbreak of WWII. This factory continued after WWII mainly building Daimler Barker Special Sports cars until Hoopers' closure.   1926: located at Olaf Street, Latimer Road, Shepherd's Bush, London W11 1938: Taken over by Hoopers 1938 1940: Hoopers taken over by Birmingham Small Arms in WWII\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Awdry, Christopher, \\'Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies,\\' Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990.  Grace\\'s Guide: ,_Brighton_and_South_Coast_Railway   The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) was formed on 27 July 1846, when the London and Brighton, and London and Croydon Railways were merged together.  The LBSCR stretched from London to Portsmouth and Hastings and the length of the track by the end of 1922 totalled 457 miles. This was comprised of 100 miles of single track, 357 miles of double line, 47 miles with three tracks, 35 miles of four tracks and 14 miles (cumulatively) with five tracks.   The LBSCR entered Victoria station in 1860, agreeing to pay half of the costs for the construction of the station. The line from Victoria to Brighton was electrified in three stages, which reached Tulse Hill and West Norwood by 1912. Due to the increasing threat from the tram network the LBSCR decided to use an overhead line instead of a third rail for electrification.  In 1893 the line was one of the pioneers of electric lighting in carriages, with 300 coaches lit. The company ran a first-class Pullman service named the \"Southern Belle\" renamed the \"Brighton Belle\" in 1934. The service made two trips daily from Victoria to Brighton taking exactly one hour in 1909.  LBSCR head offices were in Brighton and the construction of the locomotives took place at Brighton works, locomotives were also built by external contractors, for example Messrs Bury, Curtis and Kennedy, Liverpool. Lancing carriage and wagon works, near Shoreham-by-Sea was built in 1911 in order to relieve pressure of the overcrowded works at Brighton.   The first chairman of the LBSCR was Mr C. P. Grenfell, who was succeeded by Samuel Laing in 1848 (previously the Law Clerk in the Railway Department of the Board of Trade). The first secretary was J. Buckton, succeeded by F. Slight in October 1849. R. Jacomb-Hood was the first resident engineer and Peter Clarke was the first manager, however on the 14 February 1848 strong complaints made against Clarke and he was deemed as inefficient and resigned. He was succeeded by George Hawkins. William Stroudly was appointed locomotive superintendent in 1870. In 1899, William Forbes, (son of the General Manager of the Midland Great Western Railway), became General Manager of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, where he instigated the programme of overhead electrification. He is also credited with rebuilding Victoria station, extending the Pullman services, and building the Quarry line. During the war he was a member of the Railway Executive. He received a knighthood in 1915.  The LBSCR also owned the Terminus Hotel in Brighton and the London and Paris Hotel at Newhaven, to encourage more tourists to use the railway.  In 1923, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) was absorbed into the Southern Railway, as part of the ‘grouping’ process which organised railway companies into the  ‘Big Four’.   1846 - formed when London and Brighton and London and Croydon railways combined. 1923 - became a constituent of the Southern Railways under the Railways Act 1922 (The Grouping Act).',\n",

       "    'description': \"G. C. Boase, ‘Locke, Joseph (1805–1860)’, rev. Ralph Harrington, , 2004 [] Joseph Locke (1805–1860):    TNA Discovery website:  - Ref GB/NNAF/P145303   Joseph Locke was born at Attercliffe, near Sheffield, on 9 August 1805. Following an education at Barnsley grammar school, in 1823 he was apprenticed to George Stephenson as a pupil engineer. He continued to work for Stephenson after his apprenticeship ended, and was appointed as one of Stephenson's assistants in the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Locke went on to work with Stephenson on the first trunk railway line, the Grand Junction Railway between Birmingham and Warrington. Locke's work on the survey impressed the Grand Junction Railway's directors who offered him the job of building the line. This caused friction in Locke's relationship with Stephenson, and a compromise of dividing work on the line between the two men was agreed. After Stephenson left the project in August 1835, Locke took sole control of the construction of the line. Locke's work on the Grand Junction established his reputation for good engineering combined with economy and speed of construction. His other work included the construction of the main line from London to Southampton (1836–40), the line between Sheffield and Manchester (1838–40) and the Greenock, Paisley, and Glasgow line (1837–41). In 1840, Locke formed a partnership with John Edward Errington, with whom he constructed lines in Lancashire and Scotland.  Locke moved to the manor of Honiton, Devon in 1847, and was Liberal MP for the borough of Honiton from 1847 until his death.  Locke died suddenly at Moffat, near Dumfries, Scotland, on 18 September 1860.\",\n",

Warner began making bells in 1788, and continued to do so (with a hiatus between 1816 and 1850) until 1924.  Their total production of bells is unknown, but there are approximately 2550 surviving Warner bells that are hung primarily for change ringing, carrying dates from 1788 to 1921.  The Warner foundries operated at various locations in London from before 1782 until about 1924.  These locations included Cheapside, Cripplegate (commonly known as the Crescent Foundry), Spitalfields and Fleet Street. Other Warner foundries or works were located at Tendring, Essex and at Stockton-on-Tees, where the original Big Ben was cast.',\n",

Born into a wealthy French family, Antoine Lavoisier is considered to be the founder of modern chemistry. He and his wife Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze collaborated on numerous scientific projects. Lavoisier was a polymath, inspired by the ideas of the Enlightenment. His studies included philosophy and law and he invented many new instruments and very accurate quantitative methods to analyse the elements contained in chemical compounds. These inventions led him to identify the element oxygen. He also developed a new method of chemical nomenclature: a way of naming chemical substances which, with modifications, is still in use today. His experimental methods of chemical analysis were crucial for finding and isolating many medically active substances in the late 1700s from morphine to quinine. Lavoisier’s work as a tax collector for the king led to him being executed by the French revolutionaries on the guillotine. After Lavoisier’s execution, his wife continued to fight for recognition of his ideas, bringing together and publishing his final work.',\n",

       "    'description': '(1743-1817), physician  William Saunders, born in Banff, Scotland, was educated at the University of Edinburgh in medicine and graduated MD in 1765, with a thesis on antimony. He established a large practice in London in 1766 and gave lectures on chemistry with W. Keir at Red Lion Court, and materia medica at Guy\\'s Hospital, which were well attended. He also lectured on medicine and in 1770 became the first in London to advertise clinical lectures. He is said to have made £1000 a year from his lectures, which he published.  In 1770 he was elected Physician of Guy\\'s Hospital, an appointment that made the hospital\\'s embryonic medical school a reality. He lectured there for the next 32 years, each year giving three courses of four months each. His lectures on \"Chemistry and Pharmacy\" were particularly well attended.  He wrote several books. His lectures on pharmacy were published in 1767 as Compendium Medicina Practium, in which he supported the views of Sir George Baker that \"Devonshire Colic\" was caused by lead used in the seals of wooden cider presses, a famous discovery in the early history of toxicology and epidemiology. In the Library of Congress there is an 1810 American edition of his A Treatise on the Structure, Economy, and Diseases of the Liver, Together with an Inquiry into the Properties and Component Parts of the Bile and Biliary Concretions. He also published books on mercury in 1768, antimony in 1773, mephitic acid (carbonic acid) in 1777, red Peruvian bark (the source of quinine) in 1782, and mineral waters in 1800.  Saunders portrait was presented to the Royal College of Physicians by his son John James Saunders and can be seen there in Regents Park. He became a Fellow of the College in 1790. In 1792 he gave its Goulstonian lectures, on cirrhosis of the liver, which he was probably the first English physician to study. In 1796 he delivered the College\\'s Harveian oration. In 1793 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1805 he was chairman of a meeting that led to the formation of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He later became its first president. In 1807 he was appointed Physician to the Prince Regent (later King George IV).  In 1769 he married Margaret Petrie. They had two children. Margaret died in 1777, and in 1781 he married Charity Ward, by whom he had four children. Charity died in 1799. He resigned from Guy\\'s Hospital in 1802, and retired from practice in 1814, moving from Russell Square to Enfield, Middlesex, where he died on 29 May 1817.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi was born near Cordoba, Spain, when it was part of the Islamic Empire. He was a physician, surgeon and chemist. He is best remembered for his encyclopedia of medicine, the Al-Tasrif li man ajaz an-il-talif (An Aid for Those Who Lack the Capacity to Read Big Books), known as the al-Tasrif. This became a standard reference in Islamic and European medicine for over 500 years. In Europe, Al-Zahrawi was known as Albucasis, and was particularly famous for his surgical knowledge. Al-Zahrawi’s encyclopedia included sections on surgery, medicine, orthopaedics, ophthalmology, pharmacology and nutrition. In it he described over 300 diseases and their treatments. He also included detailed descriptions of numerous surgical procedures, and the use of over 200 surgical instruments, many of which he developed. The most famous section of the encyclopedia, on surgery, was translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the 1100s. From this time it also became a standard text in Europe, and was still being reprinted in the 1770s. While famed for his writing, Al-Zahrawi was also a prominent practitioner and teacher. In recognition of his skills, he was appointed as the court physician to King Al-Hakam II of Spain.',\n",

Very little is known about al-Jazari’s life, though it is thought that he served as chief engineer and adviser at the Artuklu Palace, the residence of the Mardin branch of the Turkish Artuqid dynasty. In 1206 he presented his sultan with the Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, which provides great insight into craftsmanship and engineering in medieval Arab society. Al-Jazari described in detail a number of machines and practical devices including a water wheel and several clocks, alongside instructions on how to construct them. As well as having a practical function, many of the devices were eccentrically or fancifully designed. Examples include his ‘peacock’ fountain, a hand-washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants offering soap and towels.\",\n",

The only formal education he seemed to receive was from a Richard Smith in a school at Market Bosworth. He moved to Nuneaton, Warwickshire, where he took up the profession of a schoolmaster. He taught himself mathematics- in eighteenth-century Britain many mathematicians were self-trained.   By 1736 Simpson was in London, where he continued to work, as a weaver and as a teacher of mathematics. He resided at Spitalfields where he was a tutor at the famous Mathematical Society.  In 1737 he published 'A New Treatise of Fluxions'. This was a high-quality textbook devoted to the calculus of fluxions, the Newtonian version of the infinitesimal calculus. The topic was advanced for the 1730s, when the calculus was mastered by only a few mathematicians in Europe.  Simpson also gained a broader reputation as a mathematician by answering some questions in the Ladies' Diary, a mathematical periodical where the British philomaths proposed and answered problems. His answers were published from 1736 under pseudonyms such as Marmaduke Hodgson, Hurlothrumbo, Kubernetes, Patrick O'Cavannah, and Anthony Shallow. He also contributed to the Gentleman's Magazine in 1736–8, to Miscellanea Curiosa Mathematica in 1745–6, and to the Gentleman's Diary in 1746. From about 1753 to 1760 he was editor of the Ladies' Diary.  In 1743 Simpson was appointed assistant to the chief master of mathematics at the newly formed Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, thanks to the recommendation of Martin Folkes, president of the Royal Society, and perhaps also of William Jones (1675–1749). This remained his position until his death. He was elected FRS in 1745 and in 1758 fellow of the Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Simpson was a prolific writer. His most important works are the Doctrine and Application of Fluxions (1750), Mathematical Dissertations (1743), and Miscellaneous Tracts (1757). Simpson also contributed several papers to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.  Simpson married his landlady at Nuneaton, a widow named Swinfield. They had two children, Elizabeth, born in 1736, and Thomas, born in 1738. He died at Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, on 14 May 1761.\",\n",

Its earliest origins lie in the 1540s when the Company of Barbers and the Fellowship of Surgeons joined together to form the Company of Barber-Surgeons. In the 1700s medicine became an academic discipline and surgeons demanded more recognition for their expertise. In 1745 the surgeons broke away from the barbers to form the Company of Surgeons and in 1797 bought a property in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, where the Royal College of Surgeons is still located.  By 1800 the king had granted surgeons a royal charter and the association was known as the Royal College of Surgeons in London, a name that was later changed to the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Today the Royal College performs a variety of functions, including the evaluation of clinical practice, and it also advises hospital trusts on various aspects of surgical practice.\",\n",

       "    'description': \"M. W. Kirby, ‘Stephenson, George (1781–1848)’, , 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [, accessed 12 Nov 2010] George Stephenson (1781–1848):  GB/NNAF/P163671   Stephenson, George (1781–1848), colliery and railway engineer, was born at Wylam, Northumberland, on 9 June 1781. He is often credited as being the ‘Father of Railways.’ He was the second son of Robert Stephenson, foreman at the Wylam colliery pumping engine. At fourteen he was appointed an assistant fireman to his father and when he was seventeen Robert Hawthorne employed him in the position of ‘plugman’, or engineman. Robert worked on engines at Willington Quay, Killingworth and Montrose, Scotland, before returning to Killingworth, where in 1912 he was appointed engineman and given responsibility for all the machinery at a number of collieries in the Newcastle area.  Stephenson built his first locomotive, Blucher, in 1814 for Killingworth colliery, and in 1816, he patented the ‘steam spring’ with William Losh, of Walker Ironworks, Newcastle. Losh had previously supported Stephenson’s claim that he invented the first safety lamp for underground mineworkers in 1815. In early 1822, George was appointed engineer to the Stockton and Darlington Railway, after submitting survey plans and cost estimates for the proposed line and in May 1823, the company was given permission to use steam locomotives on the line.  On 23 June 1823, George Stephenson established the engine manufacturing company Robert Stephenson & Co. with Edward Pease, Thomas Richardson and Michael Longridge, which was to be managed by George’s son, Robert. Work commenced in August 1823 and by the time the Stockton and Darlington line opened for traffic on 27 September 1825, four winding engines had been delivered together with a operational steam locomotive: Locomotion No.1.  In 1824, George was employed to undertake surveys and prepare plans for the proposed Liverpool and Manchester Railway, but the bill was rejected in parliament. A new bill was passed in 1826, and Stephenson was appointed engineer. Stephenson fought strenuously for using locomotive power on the line, and his locomotive Rocket, built under the direction of his son Robert, won the Rainhill locomotive trials, held in October 1829, to determine the best means of propulsion on the Liverpool and Manchester line.  Stephenson was chief engineer to the Grand Junction line connecting Birmingham with Liverpool and Manchester, begun in 1833 and he was also chief engineer to the following railways: Manchester to Leeds, Birmingham to Derby, Normanton to York, and Sheffield to Rotherham, and others, all begun in 1836. The Derby to Leeds Railway (afterwards called the North Midland line) was commenced under his supervision in 1837.   In 1838 Stephenson was elected vice-president of the mechanical science section of the British Association at its Newcastle meeting.  In 1845, Stephenson’s party won a parliamentary battle as supporters of the locomotive against the upholders of the atmospheric railway system, led by I.K. Brunel. In 1847 Stephenson became president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, which was founded by him that year in Birmingham. He received in 1835 the honour of knighthood from Leopold I of Belgium and in 1845 he also visited northern Spain in connection with a proposed railway. Stephenson consistently refused all proffered honours in England, however, declining a knighthood on two occasions.  He died of pleurisy at Tapton House, Tapton, near Chesterfield, on 12 August 1848. He was buried on 17 August at Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield.   1799 - began to learn to read and write in his spare time.   1801 - appointed ‘brakesman’ at the Dolly pit at Black Callerton.   1804 - moved to Killingworth following his appointment as brakesman to the West Moor colliery engine.   1814 - the Blucher constructed at the West Moor colliery.   1815 - prototype 'Geordie' safety lamp was tested at Killingworth.   1821 - recruited to the Stockton and Darlington Railway project.   1829 - first trial of The Rocket.   1830 - decided to retire completely from active work though still acted as consultant engineer on most railway projects.   1835 - received knighthood from Leopold I of Belgium.   1838 - elected vice-president of the mechanical science section of the British Association.   1847 - became president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Leonard Thompson was the first patient to receive insulin injections, in January 1922.   Before insulin, diabetes was a terminal disease. Diabetic patients like Thompson had few effective treatments. A strict diet was one of the few options that could keep patients alive.   Aged just 14, the Canadian patient had been diabetic for three years. Thompson’s condition worsened during 1921 - he was admitted to Toronto General Hospital weighing only about 65 pounds. He was close to slipping into a diabetic coma and would soon die.   Thompson’s father let the hospital try Banting and Best’s new pancreatic extract for the first time. However, the extract was an impure form of insulin. Thompson had an allergic reaction, and it had little effect.   A few days later Thompson was injected with a purer form of insulin. This was extracted by the chemist James Collip. Thompson’s blood sugars gradually returned to normal and his diabetic symptoms began to disappear. News of Thompson’s recovery spread, inspiring people with diabetes and their families to write letters to Banting and Best asking for urgent treatment.   Thompson lived another 13 years using insulin. When he was 27 he died of pneumonia - thought to be a complication of his diabetes.',\n",

       "    'description': 'BBC:  accessed 26 June 2009   The BBC is the world\\'s largest public broadcasting organisation. It was established in 1922 by the General Post Office as the British Broadcasting Company.  John Reith, a Scottish Calvinist, was appointed its General Manager in December 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast. The company was initially financed by a royalty on the sale of BBC wireless receiving sets from approved manufacturers.   In 1923, the BBC introduced a licence fee of 10 shillings. In 1926, following the Government\\'s acceptance of the recommendation made by the Crawford Committee (1925–26) that the British Broadcasting Company be replaced by a non-commercial, Crown-chartered organisation, it became the British Broadcasting Corporation. The British Broadcasting Corporation came into existence on 1 January 1927, and Reith – newly knighted – was appointed its first Director General.  Experimental television broadcasts were started in 1932, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by John Logie Baird. Limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1934, and an expanded service (now named the BBC Television Service) started from Alexandra Palace in 1936, alternating between an improved Baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic 405 line Marconi-EMI system. The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year.  Television broadcasting was suspended from 1 September 1939 to 7 June 1946, during the Second World War. The BBC moved much of its radio operations out of London, initially to Bristol, and then to Bedford.   In the late 1960s the BBC reorganised and renamed their radio channels. On 30 September 1967, the Light Programme was split into Radio 1 offering continuous \"Popular\" music and Radio 2 more \"Easy Listening\". The \"Third\" programme became Radio 3 offering classical music and cultural programming. The Home Service became Radio 4 offering news, and non-musical content such as quiz shows, readings, dramas and plays. As well as the four national channels, a series of local BBC radio stations were established in 1967, including Radio London.  In 1969, the BBC Enterprises department was formed to exploit BBC brands and programmes for commercial spin-off products. In 1979, it became a wholly owned limited company, BBC Enterprises Ltd.  In 1974, the BBC\\'s teletext service, Ceefax, was introduced, created initially to provide subtitling, but developed into a news and information service.   In 1988 the BBC sold off the Hulton Press Library, a photographic archive which had been acquired from the Picture Post magazine by the BBC in 1957. The archive was sold to Brian Deutsch and is now owned by Getty Images. BBC Enterprises was reorganised and relaunched in 1995, as BBC Worldwide Ltd. In 1998, BBC studios, outside broadcasts, post production, design, costumes and wigs were spun off into BBC Resources Ltd.  In 1990 Radio 5 was launched as a sports and educational station, but was replaced in 1994, with Radio 5 Live. In 1997, BBC News 24, a rolling news channel, launched on digital television services and the following year, BBC Choice launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed BBC Parliament. In 1999, BBC Knowledge launched as a multi media channel, with services available on the newly launched BBC Text digital teletext service, and on BBC Online.   In 2002, several television and radio channels were reorganised. BBC Knowledge was replaced by BBC Four and became the BBC\\'s arts and documentaries channel. CBBC, which had been a programming strand as Children\\'s BBC since 1985, was split into CBBC and CBeebies, for younger children, with both new services getting a digital channel: the CBBC Channel and CBeebies Channel. In addition to the television channels, new digital radio stations were created: 1Xtra, 6 Music and BBC7. BBC 1Xtra was a sister station to Radio 1 and specialised in modern black music, BBC 6 Music specialised in alternative music genres and BBC7 specialised in archive, speech and children\\'s programming.  In 2003, BBC Choice was replaced by BBC Three, with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries, BBC News 24 became the BBC News Channel in 2008, and BBC Radio 7 became BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on Radio 4. In 2008, another channel was launched, BBC Alba, a Scottish Gaelic service.   1922 - Founded by Royal Charter and began radio broadcasts as the British Broadcasting Company Ltd;  1927 - Incorporated as the British Broadcasting Corporation;  1932 - began television broadcasts  The BBC is the world\\'s largest public broadcasting organisation, underwritten by the British Government and paid for through a licence fee levied on the British public; began on-line publishing and broadcasting on the internet in 1996.',\n",

       "    'description': \"; ;       The Russian physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov became famous for his experiments on dogs (‘Pavlov's dogs’). These experiments investigated how the nervous system controls the process of digestion. They were the basis for Pavlov's further work on conditional reflexes. He showed that dogs could be conditioned to salivate when they heard a bell, which they associated with feeding.  Pavlov's experiments on dogs differed from the usual animal experimentation, which tended to require vivisection and the death of the animal. Pavlov's dogs were kept alive and healthy in order to study their normal, long-term function.  Originally, Pavlov had entered a theological school to become a priest, like his father. However, he abandoned the school to study science and medicine in St Petersburg and in Leipzig. Pavlov was an outstanding student; he won prizes at university, and gathered recognition and academic positions afterwards. He became director of the newly founded St Petersburg Institute of Experimental Medicine in 1890, a position that he held until his death.  In 1904 Pavlov received a Nobel Prize in recognition of his work on digestion. He was supported by the Soviet regime and garnered praise from Lenin, but he was not a supporter of Soviet Communism and was an outspoken critic of Lenin's successor, Joseph Stalin. Pavlov died at the age of 86, asking one of his students to record the circumstances of his death for future study.\",\n",

       "    'description': \"1947-1962  The Transport Act 1947 nationalised virtually all British transport, including the railways, waterways, and road haulage. These were transferred to a newly-created operating body, the British Transport Commission (BTC). The British Transport Commission began operations on 1st January 1948, under Chairman Sir (later Lord) Cyril Hurcomb. At this time, the British Transport Commission acquired the “Big Four” grouped railways, with virtually all minor railways as well, together with the London Passenger Transport Board. This automatically transferred the assets of the rail companies to BTC, including ships, ports, hotels, and investments in bus, coach, and haulage companies. Two bus companies, Tilling and Scottish Motor Traction, were soon added, as well as long-distance road hauliers. The Transport Act charged the British Transport Commission with the task of charged with “integrating” various forms of transport into single public service.   The British Transport Commission did not directly operate transport services. Operations were delegated to five separately appointed executives: Docks and Inland Waterways, Hotels, London Transport, Road Transport, and Railways. The Railways Executive operated under the name British Railways. In 1949, the Road Transport Executive was divided into two separate executives: Road Haulage and Road Passenger. The Commission exercised financial control over these Executives, and managed them through schemes of delegation.   The Commission attempted to fulfil its statutory duty to “integrate” public transport by introducing Area Schemes. These were designed to establish regional monopolies for road passenger transport, ports, and harbours. “Integration” was also to be promoted through Charges Schemes, in which the true costs of different modes of transport were to be reflected in the charges. This was designed to attract traffic to the most economic and efficient mode of transport.   The structure of Executives was dramatically altered by the Transport Act 1953, which abolished all Executives, with the exception of London Transport. Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of transport systems was delegated to the chief regional managers. The railways were reorganised into a system of area boards for each of its six regions. In September 1953, Sir Brian Robertson became Chairman. Disposal of the haulage fleet also began at this time, but a lack of buyers made this difficult.   Rising costs, industrial action and competition from road traffic meant that the British Transport Commission was in financial trouble by 1955. It sought relief from this by publishing The Modernisation and Re-equipment of British Railways, a plan which proposed an investment in the railways of £1,240m over fifteen years. The main features of this plan were the replacement of steam with electric and diesel traction, the electrification of principle routes, and the introduction of new coaching stock.   Despite the modernisation plan, the financial position of the British Transport Commission worsened. Two government reviews, in 1956 and 1959, concluded that the Commission was unwieldy and had an insufficiently commercial outlook.   Sir Brian Robertson retired in May 1961, and was replaced by Dr Richard Beeching.   The BTC was abolished by the Transport Act 1962. It was replaced with five new authorities that were answerable to the Minister of Transport: the British Railways Board, the British Transport Docks Board, the British Waterways Board, the London Transport Board, and the Transport Holding Company. Dr Beeching became chair of the British Railways Board.   Created during nationalisation but ran into financial difficulties in the late 1950's. It was abolished by the 1962 Transport Act when British Railways Board was created to replace it.\",\n",

Studied metallurgy and experimented. Discovered (1875) a method for eliminating phosphorous from pig-iron (a major impurity in some iron ores) in the Bessemer converter. He devised a process in 1876-1877 with his cousin Percy (Carlyle) Gilchrist (1851-1935) for manufacturing low -phosphorous steel. The method is now called the Thomas-Gilchrist process, the Thomas process or the Basic process. Secured a large fortune from his patents. Visited United States, 1881.

Their total production of bells is unknown, but there are approximately 2550 surviving Warner bells that are hung primarily for change ringing, carrying dates from 1788 to 1921.  The Warner foundries operated at various locations in London from before 1782 until about 1924.  These locations included Cheapside, Cripplegate (commonly known as the Crescent Foundry), Spitalfields and Fleet Street.

At seventeen he became a pupil on a farm. After serving with the imperial yeomanry in the South African War he became an aeronautical engineer, using his observation of seabirds in flight to design a revolutionary type of monoplane with swept-back wings. The War Office was sufficiently impressed to employ him, with a view to the production of a prototype, in 1906, but the model was not accepted.  Dunne is a fascinating figure who was one of the first two aeroplane designers employed at the Army Balloon Factory Farnborough (subsequently the Royal Aircraft Factory. (The other was the American S F Cody). His swept-wing tail-less automatically stable designs were original and were seen as an important defence innovation in the years before WW1.   Like Dunne’s aerodynamics, his philosophy was also unconventional and tried to reconcile psychic phenomena as well as pre-cognition, dreams and ‘deja-vu’ with emerging contemporary science, including relativity but also studies of psychoanalysis and the unconscious.  In this, he was part of an interwar ‘para-scientific’ movement which tried to make sense of the new science in personal and psychological terms.   In 1927 Dunne published his book - 'An Experiment With Time' - it described a succession of his dreams over a thirty year period which seemed to show glimpses of the future and provided a theory of time to account for them. H. G. Wells found the book 'fantastically interesting' and it was praised in 'Nature' which might have been sceptical. ‘Dunne dreams’ became common colloquial usage for dreams foreshadowing future experiences. His ‘serialism’, however, the theory he provided to account for them, failed to convince scientists that it fused with the new physics. The book was revised and expanded in 1934 and remained in print for over half a century.   In 1928 Dunne married Cicely Marion Violet Joan they had one son and one daughter. Dunne died on 24th August 1949 in Tracey House Nursing Home, Banbury   from 1904  - designed a series of aeronautical models, gliders and powered aeroplanes 1927 - published An Experiment with Time, revised and expanded in 1934 J B Priestley based Time and the Conways, published in 1937, on his interpretation of Dunne's theory.\",\n",

Previously the Meter Department of GEC it was incorporated at the same time as the newly formed Connor-Peel Telephone Company, both of the businesses shared the same premises at Bow Street Works. The two companies were also wholly owned subsidiarys of GEC.  Salford Electrical Instruments Ltd eventually took over the whole of the building when a ten acre plot of land was purchased in Stoke, Coventry for the construction of a magneto works. Once the factory had been established a further 136 acres was purchased and construction of the factory on the new site was completed by 1921, this enabled Salford Electrical Instruments Ltd to occupy the whole of the Peel Works from then on.  In the early Nineties the company had been experiencing trading difficulties and had sold off various interests including its Magnetic Materials to Neoside Limited and Mining Product business to Rowe Hankins Components Ltd in 1993. The company also sold the crystals division to Plessey Semiconductors in August 1993, which left it to concentrate on products for the automotive industry, eventually relocating to Portsmouth in June, 1993. On the 22nd December 1993 the land and buildings along with all other assets were transferred to the General Electric Company, plc. Eventually GEC merged with British Aerospace Engineering to form BAE Systems in 1999.  As a consequence of this Salford Electrical Instruments Ltd became part of this group, although is now effectively a dormant company, as it is not trading under its own account.   Traded at Silk St., Salford, Manchester, England (1930s-1990).  Formerly part of the GEC group they were taken over by Sailcrest Engineers Ltd., who now (2007) trade as Sailcrest Magntics Ltd.\",\n",

Their most popular camera was the Jano Postcard, a camera designed to take a card negative which was then developed and placed in a hinged holder to be swung up in front of the lens where it was rephotographed to produce a positive. From 1950, an improved model for 'positive' cards needed only one exposure to produce the finished print. The company was last heard of in the late 1950s, by which time it was calling itself Jano Camera Co.\",\n",

One such case is that of Laura Davies, whose death in 1993 had a huge impact on multiple transplant surgery in the UK. She was born with gastroschisis, which meant she was unable to digest food. At the time, an operation to replace Laura's small bowel and liver was unavailable in the UK, so her parents travelled to Pittsburgh, where this highly experimental surgery was available.  Laura's surgery in the United States was funded by donations from the public. Her surgery was successful and she began to recover. Unfortunately, she developed cancerous growths on her other organs because of the high level of anti-rejection drugs that she had to take. One year later Laura went back to Pittsburgh to have her small bowel, liver, kidneys, stomach and pancreas replaced. This was the most ambitious multi-organ transplant ever attempted, but it was unsuccessful and Laura died in November 1993.  Criticism has been levelled at the surgeons in the United States who attempted radical five-organ transplant surgery, but the argument has been put forward that these experimental procedures may become more common in the future as medical knowledge expands.\",\n",

They worked side by side in a studio that they built in their home in Westport, Connecticut.  Gardin Fraser’s career in sculpture began with creating medals, coins, fountains and animals for which she is well known. She was the first woman to design a coin for the US Treasury and was commissioned to do several monuments, including the double equestrian statue of Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson in Wyman Park, Baltimore, Maryland, the three relief panels at the entrance to the library at West Point Academy, and a white granite figure of Pegasus at Brook Green Gardens, South Carolina.

Sally Gregory Kohlstedt (University of Chicago Press, 1997)      Laura Bassi was an Italian scientist and the first woman professor to be appointed at a European university. She was born in Bologna in 1711. Her father, a wealthy lawyer, decided she should be fully educated at home, and she was tutored for seven years. Bassi developed an interest in science, and was encouraged by her family and friends, including Cardinal Prospero Lambertini (a future pope), to seek an academic post.  At the age of 21, in 1732, she was appointed Professor of Anatomy at the University of Bologna. Two years later she was given a position in philosophy. In 1738 she married a fellow academic, Guiseppe Varetti, with whom she had eight children.  Bassi approached the university requesting more teaching work and was allowed to give classes in her own home, setting up a laboratory for her students. Bassi taught a course on Newtonian physics for 28 years, and was one of the key figures in introducing Newton’s physics and philosophy to Italy. She wrote 28 published articles, mainly on physics and hydraulics.  In 1745 she was appointed to an elite group of academics known as the Benedettini, set up by Lambertini, who was now pope. In 1776, aged 65, she was appointed to a professorship in experimental physics at the Institute of Sciences, with her husband as teaching assistant. Two years later she died, but her influence on Italian physics, and her long career, helped break new ground for female academics.\",\n",

One such case is that of Laura Davies, whose death in 1993 had a huge impact on multiple transplant surgery in the UK. She was born with gastroschisis, which meant she was unable to digest food. At the time, an operation to replace Laura's small bowel and liver was unavailable in the UK, so her parents travelled to Pittsburgh, where this highly experimental surgery was available.  Laura's surgery in the United States was funded by donations from the public. Her surgery was successful and she began to recover. Unfortunately, she developed cancerous growths on her other organs because of the high level of anti-rejection drugs that she had to take. One year later Laura went back to Pittsburgh to have her small bowel, liver, kidneys, stomach and pancreas replaced. This was the most ambitious multi-organ transplant ever attempted, but it was unsuccessful and Laura died in November 1993.  Criticism has been levelled at the surgeons in the United States who attempted radical five-organ transplant surgery, but the argument has been put forward that these experimental procedures may become more common in the future as medical knowledge expands.\",\n",

Sally Gregory Kohlstedt (University of Chicago Press, 1997)      Laura Bassi was an Italian scientist and the first woman professor to be appointed at a European university. She was born in Bologna in 1711. Her father, a wealthy lawyer, decided she should be fully educated at home, and she was tutored for seven years. Bassi developed an interest in science, and was encouraged by her family and friends, including Cardinal Prospero Lambertini (a future pope), to seek an academic post.  At the age of 21, in 1732, she was appointed Professor of Anatomy at the University of Bologna. Two years later she was given a position in philosophy. In 1738 she married a fellow academic, Guiseppe Varetti, with whom she had eight children.  Bassi approached the university requesting more teaching work and was allowed to give classes in her own home, setting up a laboratory for her students. Bassi taught a course on Newtonian physics for 28 years, and was one of the key figures in introducing Newton’s physics and philosophy to Italy. She wrote 28 published articles, mainly on physics and hydraulics.  In 1745 she was appointed to an elite group of academics known as the Benedettini, set up by Lambertini, who was now pope. In 1776, aged 65, she was appointed to a professorship in experimental physics at the Institute of Sciences, with her husband as teaching assistant. Two years later she died, but her influence on Italian physics, and her long career, helped break new ground for female academics.\",\n",

       "    'title': 'Holcroft, Harold',\n",
       "    'description': '8 January 2008   Harold Holcroft, was a railway engineer, born in Wolverhampton on the 12th of February 1882.  His interest in railways, especially in locomotives, began at an early age. This was in part thanks to the inspiration of family friend Joe Armstrong, son of Joseph Armstrong, who would visit when Holcroft was growing up. At the time, Armstrong was the assistant to the Chief Locomotive Engineer at the Great Western Railway (GWR). As a result, Holcroft developed a strong fondness for the Great Western and the Stafford Road works in particular. In 1898, when Holcroft was 16, he chose to undertake a five year apprenticeship there. At the age of 18, he designed a system to improve the efficiency of continuous brakes on engines used for freight and shunting work, drawing the attention of his superiors at GWR. Once his apprenticeship finished in 1903, he was transferred to the Drawing Office where he aided in designing locomotives and plans for extensions and improvements of the works.   Following this, Holcroft moved to the Swindon Drawing Office in 1906, where he assisted in the design of George Churchward’s locomotives, and improvements to the Swindon works. Part of his work here involved improving the attractiveness of Churchward’s designs, which had been criticized by some. Holcroft made aesthetic changes to some locomotives, which were applied to a large number of GWR locomotives (the National Railway Museum’s own GWR 4003 “Lode Star” features some of these elements). It was also during his time here that Holcroft designed and patented his conjugated valve gear for three-cylinder locomotives. In July 1909, he took a trip to Canada and the United States with a group of engineers to see various works and engineering projects. This visit inspired him, especially the many 2-6-0 “Mogul” arrangement locomotives he saw, which inspired the GWR 4300 Class locomotives.   As it became clear that Churchward had no further plans for new locomotive designs in the near future, Holcroft began to seek out a new opportunity. In 1914, he moved on to the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, where Richard Maunsell required someone to execute plans for extending and reorganising the locomotive, carriage, and wagon shops at Ashford. However, the war quickly postponed these plans. Soon after joining the railway, Holcroft suffered a bout of illness, during which time he further worked on his conjugated valve. In 1919, Nigel Gresley requested to meet Holcroft to discuss their ideas regarding three-cylinder locomotives. Following their collaboration, Gresley incorporated the ideas into his three-cylinder designs. Gresley inquired as to the possibility of hiring Holcroft, but Maunsell refused to allow it.  Following the “grouping” of the railways in 1923, Holcroft moved to Maunsell’s new office as Chief Mechanical Engineer at Southern Railway. Holcroft set about dealing with the issues presented by the grouping; for example, the various railways and locomotives now amalgamated together were not necessarily compatible, and Holcroft was tasked with ascertaining where locomotives would or would not be able to run. Not long after, in 1926, Holcroft became Chief Assistant to Maunsell. He continued to work on issues such as standardizing parts within the new Southern Railway, improving sheds and depots, and a wide array of other tasks. Of course, his favourite work was still undertaking trials on the footplate of locomotives. In the 1930s, he took part in a number of trials relating to steam conservation technology.   When Maunsell retired in 1937, Oliver Bulleid took over his role. Holcroft remained, but the more hands-on approach of the new chief meant Holcroft had less responsibility over the aspects of his role he most cherished. Holcroft and Bulleid became good friends, and after Holcroft’s retirement in 1946 they remained in touch until the latter’s death. Following Holcroft’s retirement from the Southern Railway, he wrote a number of books, journal articles and papers. He continued to write until the age of 90, when he finished a manuscript for his final book, although it was never published. He died on the 15th of February 1973.   Locomotive engineer and designer working for Great Western Railways; worked apprenticeship at Stafford Road GWR Works, Wolverhampton, before working at Swindon and Waterloo; retired from Southern Railways in 1946, then working for ten years with Institute of Civil Engineers on railway periodicals.

       "    'title': 'Holcroft, Harold',\n",
       "    'description': '8 January 2008   Harold Holcroft, was a railway engineer, born in Wolverhampton on the 12th of February 1882.  His interest in railways, especially in locomotives, began at an early age. This was in part thanks to the inspiration of family friend Joe Armstrong, son of Joseph Armstrong, who would visit when Holcroft was growing up. At the time, Armstrong was the assistant to the Chief Locomotive Engineer at the Great Western Railway (GWR). As a result, Holcroft developed a strong fondness for the Great Western and the Stafford Road works in particular. In 1898, when Holcroft was 16, he chose to undertake a five year apprenticeship there. At the age of 18, he designed a system to improve the efficiency of continuous brakes on engines used for freight and shunting work, drawing the attention of his superiors at GWR. Once his apprenticeship finished in 1903, he was transferred to the Drawing Office where he aided in designing locomotives and plans for extensions and improvements of the works.   Following this, Holcroft moved to the Swindon Drawing Office in 1906, where he assisted in the design of George Churchward’s locomotives, and improvements to the Swindon works. Part of his work here involved improving the attractiveness of Churchward’s designs, which had been criticized by some. Holcroft made aesthetic changes to some locomotives, which were applied to a large number of GWR locomotives (the National Railway Museum’s own GWR 4003 “Lode Star” features some of these elements). It was also during his time here that Holcroft designed and patented his conjugated valve gear for three-cylinder locomotives. In July 1909, he took a trip to Canada and the United States with a group of engineers to see various works and engineering projects. This visit inspired him, especially the many 2-6-0 “Mogul” arrangement locomotives he saw, which inspired the GWR 4300 Class locomotives.   As it became clear that Churchward had no further plans for new locomotive designs in the near future, Holcroft began to seek out a new opportunity. In 1914, he moved on to the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, where Richard Maunsell required someone to execute plans for extending and reorganising the locomotive, carriage, and wagon shops at Ashford. However, the war quickly postponed these plans. Soon after joining the railway, Holcroft suffered a bout of illness, during which time he further worked on his conjugated valve. In 1919, Nigel Gresley requested to meet Holcroft to discuss their ideas regarding three-cylinder locomotives. Following their collaboration, Gresley incorporated the ideas into his three-cylinder designs. Gresley inquired as to the possibility of hiring Holcroft, but Maunsell refused to allow it.  Following the “grouping” of the railways in 1923, Holcroft moved to Maunsell’s new office as Chief Mechanical Engineer at Southern Railway. Holcroft set about dealing with the issues presented by the grouping; for example, the various railways and locomotives now amalgamated together were not necessarily compatible, and Holcroft was tasked with ascertaining where locomotives would or would not be able to run. Not long after, in 1926, Holcroft became Chief Assistant to Maunsell. He continued to work on issues such as standardizing parts within the new Southern Railway, improving sheds and depots, and a wide array of other tasks. Of course, his favourite work was still undertaking trials on the footplate of locomotives. In the 1930s, he took part in a number of trials relating to steam conservation technology.   When Maunsell retired in 1937, Oliver Bulleid took over his role. Holcroft remained, but the more hands-on approach of the new chief meant Holcroft had less responsibility over the aspects of his role he most cherished. Holcroft and Bulleid became good friends, and after Holcroft’s retirement in 1946 they remained in touch until the latter’s death. Following Holcroft’s retirement from the Southern Railway, he wrote a number of books, journal articles and papers. He continued to write until the age of 90, when he finished a manuscript for his final book, although it was never published. He died on the 15th of February 1973.   Locomotive engineer and designer working for Great Western Railways; worked apprenticeship at Stafford Road GWR Works, Wolverhampton, before working at Swindon and Waterloo; retired from Southern Railways in 1946, then working for ten years with Institute of Civil Engineers on railway periodicals.

       "    'title': 'Holcroft, Harold',\n",
       "    'description': '8 January 2008   Harold Holcroft, was a railway engineer, born in Wolverhampton on the 12th of February 1882.  His interest in railways, especially in locomotives, began at an early age. This was in part thanks to the inspiration of family friend Joe Armstrong, son of Joseph Armstrong, who would visit when Holcroft was growing up. At the time, Armstrong was the assistant to the Chief Locomotive Engineer at the Great Western Railway (GWR). As a result, Holcroft developed a strong fondness for the Great Western and the Stafford Road works in particular. In 1898, when Holcroft was 16, he chose to undertake a five year apprenticeship there. At the age of 18, he designed a system to improve the efficiency of continuous brakes on engines used for freight and shunting work, drawing the attention of his superiors at GWR. Once his apprenticeship finished in 1903, he was transferred to the Drawing Office where he aided in designing locomotives and plans for extensions and improvements of the works.   Following this, Holcroft moved to the Swindon Drawing Office in 1906, where he assisted in the design of George Churchward’s locomotives, and improvements to the Swindon works. Part of his work here involved improving the attractiveness of Churchward’s designs, which had been criticized by some. Holcroft made aesthetic changes to some locomotives, which were applied to a large number of GWR locomotives (the National Railway Museum’s own GWR 4003 “Lode Star” features some of these elements). It was also during his time here that Holcroft designed and patented his conjugated valve gear for three-cylinder locomotives. In July 1909, he took a trip to Canada and the United States with a group of engineers to see various works and engineering projects. This visit inspired him, especially the many 2-6-0 “Mogul” arrangement locomotives he saw, which inspired the GWR 4300 Class locomotives.   As it became clear that Churchward had no further plans for new locomotive designs in the near future, Holcroft began to seek out a new opportunity. In 1914, he moved on to the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, where Richard Maunsell required someone to execute plans for extending and reorganising the locomotive, carriage, and wagon shops at Ashford. However, the war quickly postponed these plans. Soon after joining the railway, Holcroft suffered a bout of illness, during which time he further worked on his conjugated valve. In 1919, Nigel Gresley requested to meet Holcroft to discuss their ideas regarding three-cylinder locomotives. Following their collaboration, Gresley incorporated the ideas into his three-cylinder designs. Gresley inquired as to the possibility of hiring Holcroft, but Maunsell refused to allow it.  Following the “grouping” of the railways in 1923, Holcroft moved to Maunsell’s new office as Chief Mechanical Engineer at Southern Railway. Holcroft set about dealing with the issues presented by the grouping; for example, the various railways and locomotives now amalgamated together were not necessarily compatible, and Holcroft was tasked with ascertaining where locomotives would or would not be able to run. Not long after, in 1926, Holcroft became Chief Assistant to Maunsell. He continued to work on issues such as standardizing parts within the new Southern Railway, improving sheds and depots, and a wide array of other tasks. Of course, his favourite work was still undertaking trials on the footplate of locomotives. In the 1930s, he took part in a number of trials relating to steam conservation technology.   When Maunsell retired in 1937, Oliver Bulleid took over his role. Holcroft remained, but the more hands-on approach of the new chief meant Holcroft had less responsibility over the aspects of his role he most cherished. Holcroft and Bulleid became good friends, and after Holcroft’s retirement in 1946 they remained in touch until the latter’s death. Following Holcroft’s retirement from the Southern Railway, he wrote a number of books, journal articles and papers. He continued to write until the age of 90, when he finished a manuscript for his final book, although it was never published. He died on the 15th of February 1973.   Locomotive engineer and designer working for Great Western Railways; worked apprenticeship at Stafford Road GWR Works, Wolverhampton, before working at Swindon and Waterloo; retired from Southern Railways in 1946, then working for ten years with Institute of Civil Engineers on railway periodicals.

       "    'description': \"O  devised homeopathy in Liepzig in 1796      Samuel Hahnemann was a German physician who established a new system of medical treatment called homeopathy. He spoke many languages and supported himself as a translator while studying medicine, graduating in 1779. Hahnemann became convinced that many medical treatments such as bloodletting did more harm than good, and looked for gentler ways to treat patients. He was one of many physicians in the 1700s who set out to explore systematically the use and effects of medical drugs. Hahnemann suggested testing the effects of drugs on the healthy human body in order to obtain secure knowledge of a drug's effects. Following self-experimentation with the antimalarial drug quinine, Hahnemann noted that the drug had a similar effect to the illness it was supposed to cure - in a healthy person, a dose of quinine caused a fever. From this, Hahnemann developed the central idea of homeopathic medicine: the principle of 'like cures like' or the 'law of similars' - an idea that was also central to folk medicine. When Edward Jenner introduced vaccination in 1798, Hahnemann considered this a confirmation of his principle. Hahnemann also came to assume that the body was highly sensitive to drugs during illness, and prescribed very small doses of drugs - hence the expression ‘homeopathic doses’ for very small amounts. Homeopathy spread rapidly through Europe in the early 1800s. The first homeopathic hospital opened in 1832 in Leipzig. However, homeopathy also met with hostility from apothecaries and other medical practitioners. In 1835, Hahnemann moved to Paris, where he was a popular practitioner until his death.\",\n",

It was set up in 1863 in Geneva, Switzerland, by five private individuals. The idea behind the Red Cross was to ensure armies coordinated the work of their volunteers to care for the sick and wounded. It provided training for both men and women in caring for the sick and wounded, and spread new nursing techniques across the world.  Dunant also proposed that countries should adopt an international agreement which would recognise the special status of medical services and the wounded on the battlefield. This agreement - the original Geneva Convention - was adopted in 1864. In 1919 the International League of Red Cross Societies was established to coordinate the activities of Red Cross movements from different countries. They were responsible for both wartime and civilian care. During the Second World War the Red Cross colleted more than 13 million pints of blood and processed about 10 million pints into plasma.  The Red Crescent emblem was first used in 1876, and in 1929 the two movements were formally joined to create the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.',\n",

Her elder brother William emigrated to Bath, England in 1757 after the French defeat of the Hanoverians during the Seven Years War. During this time, Caroline was kept at home, but briefly attended a dressmaking school. William engineered Caroline's move to Bath, resisted by their siblings and mother, ostensibly to see if she could train as a concert singer.  She took over the Bath household, and despite speaking little English, soon emerged as a concert singer in the West Country that sometimes performed five nights a week. When her brother's interest moved towards astronomy, the two moved to Windsor, where William assumed Caroline would assist his studies, whilst also running his household. He built her a telescope in 1783 with the express aim of seeking comets and other travelling celestial bodies.  In the years after, Caroline became famous as the discoverer (or co-discoverer) of eight comets. In 1783 she discovered the companion to the Andromeda nebula. The siblings' joint work into nebulae saw the known number increase from little over a hundred to more than two thousand thanks to their efforts, in a period spanning two decades.  Caroline was awarded a royal pension in 1787. From 1796, she worked to correct the errors in John Flamsteed's 'British Catalogue'. The task took close to two years and embedded her reputation as one of Britain's most respected astronomers of the day. Such was the respect her name commanded at this time that she was invited to Greenwich as a guest of the Astronomer Royal in the summer of 1799.  When William died in 1822, Caroline returned to Hanover, where she continued her research. She undertook the considerable task of revising the entire catalogue of nebulae. Her efforts saw her rewarded with a medal from the Astronomical Society. In her later years, Caroline became something of a minor celebrity where she lived and she was granted a 'science medal' by Humboldt on behalf of the King of Prussia when she turned ninety-six. She died in 1848 in Hanover.\",\n",

Son of Sir William Henry Bragg (1862-1942)   William Lawrence Bragg was born and spent his early life in Adelaide, Australia. His British father, William Henry Bragg, had relocated to Australia in 1886 to take up the chair in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Adelaide. His father was the first to make an x-ray tube in Australia, and had a great influence on his son's educational interests, as did his mother, Gwendoline Todd, an artist.   In 1909 the Bragg family relocated to England. A few years later, the father and son duo co-developed x-ray crystallography, which applied x-rays to crystals in order to reveal the atomic structure of molecules. The new field would become known as x-ray crystallogaphy, and would transform science and medicine, ushering in a new era of molecular biology. In 1915 the Braggs shared the Nobel Prize in 1915. At the age of 25, Lawrence Bragg remains the youngest Nobel Laureate in science. Together, they helped establish Britain's as leaders in x-ray crystallograpy.   Following his Nobel prize-winning work, Lawrence Bragg had an eminent career as a scientist and public figure, leading the scientific reserach at Cambridge's famous Cavendish Laboratory, which included overseeing the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953. Bragg appeared on many radio and television programmes as a broadcaster. He followed in his father's footsteps in becoming the Director of the Royal Institution, where he concentrated on the public promotion of science. Like his mother, he became a keen painter, especially watercolour. In his later years, one of his aims was to encourage the bridging of the so-called 'two cultures' of science and the arts, one of the concerns of his protégé C. P. Snow.\",\n",

When he was fifteen, Ackermann was apprenticed to his elder brother Friedrich, a saddler. During his apprenticeship, he also learned to draw and engrave. In 1782 started training as a carriage designer, first in Dresden and then at Hueningen, in Switzerland. In 1784 he was employed for six months by Antoine Carassi in Paris. He worked for the carriage maker Simons in Brussels in 1785–6. He moved to England in 1787, where his model of a state coach for the carriage maker Goodall led to his first important commission in 1790, to design a state coach for the lord lieutenant of Ireland. Between 1791 and 1820 he published thirteen books of designs for carriages.   Ackermann formed close connections with other émigrés from Saxony, most significantly with the Facius brothers and with J. C. Stadler, who worked as engravers for the leading print publisher John Boydell. From 1795-1805, he ran a drawing school in Strand, and in 1796 he published the first of many drawing books. In 1797, he began publishing decorative hand-coloured prints.  During the first decade of the 19th century, Ackermann continued to design state and other carriages.  He became a United Kingdom citizen on 24 March 1809.  In 1808 and 1809, Ackermann issued two publications which secured his reputation as a publisher of the finest colour plate books: The Microcosm of London, and the monthly magazine Repository of Arts. Ackermann employed the architectural draughtsman Augustus Pugin, and the figure drawer Thomas Rowlandson to provide illustrations and architectural drawings for his engravings.  Ackermann formally handed over his business, Ackermann & Co, to his younger sons in October 1832. He suffered a stroke in November 1833 and died on 30 March 1834 at his home at Cold Harbour, Finchley.   1825: established in a print shop at 191 Regent Street, London',\n",

It employed highly skilled craftsmen such as Thomas Griffits and did much to advance the use of colour lithography. It printed many of London Transport’s pictorial posters, often using it’s own artists such as Shep.  The Baynard Press was amongst the largest and most technically accomplished printing firms in Britain. They had machinery and plant resources that allowed them to produce large-scale poster images for the advertising of London Transport and various other organisations.   The Baynard Press also maintained a level of technical excellence through the employment of Thomas Griffits and other master craftsmen. This allowed the firm to produce work of the highest standard. At the outbreak of WW2, the entire resources of the firm were made available to support the war effort.\",\n",

In 1967 he transplanted the heart from a young brain-dead woman to Louis Washkansky, who had incurable heart disease. Although Washkansky lived for only 18 days after his surgery, Barnard had passed a milestone in transplant surgery and became famous overnight.  Barnard's experimental surgery prompted other surgeons to attempt heart transplants. In 1968 a hundred heart transplant procedures were attempted but they all failed and every recipient died. The advent of drugs such as ciclosporin, which reduced the chances of organ rejection, ensured that patients survived for longer periods than Louis Washkansky.  Barnard continued to transplant hearts and his longest-surviving patient lived for 24 years after her surgery.\",\n",

       "    'description': \"Robert Rhodes James, ‘Wellcome, Sir Henry Solomon (1853–1936)’, , Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 [] Sir Henry Solomon Wellcome (1853–1936):       Henry Wellcome was an American-born pharmacist and philanthropist whose huge personal fortune was spent on medical research and collecting medical objects.   Wellcome was born in the United States in 1853. When he was 8 years old, the town he lived in, Garden City in Minnesota, was attacked by the Sioux. He assisted his uncle, a medical practitioner and drug store owner, in caring for the wounded, and helped make bullets for the town's defence. This event had a big influence on Wellcome, triggering his interest in pharmaceuticals, and - despite the violence of the encounter - other cultures.  Wellcome went on to study pharmacy and became a travelling pharmaceuticals salesman. In 1880 he founded the pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome & Co. with a former fellow student, Silas Mainville Burroughs (d. 1895). The company imported a new form of compacted pills from the US; these pills were safer than traditional pills prepared with pestle and mortar because they contained standardised doses of drugs. Burroughs Wellcome registered this new form of pill under the trade name Tabloid - a name which now has come to refer to anything in compact form, especially ‘tabloid’ newspapers.  The company was highly successful, and Wellcome used his wealth to fund various activities. He founded scientific research laboratories, and collected over one and a half million historical objects and books related to the history of medicine around the world. Many of these objects are now on display in London at the Wellcome Collection, at the Science Museum and on this website.  Wellcome pursued other interests as well, such as leading an archaeological excavation in Sudan and aerial photography. Before his death in 1936, Wellcome set up a trust to fund biomedical research. The Wellcome Trust is now the largest charity in the UK, and the second largest medical research charity in the world.\",\n",

Brin’s Oxygen Company was formed in 1886 to exploit the patent rights for a process developed by Arthur and Leon Brin, two French brothers, after they had taken out a patent for the process of separating oxygen, known as the Brin process.  A little later a German engineer, Carl Von Linde developed a new cryogenic separation process for which he won the patent rights, the Brin brothers negotiated an agreement with Linde to use the new process which entailed giving Linde a stake and a position on the board of the company. He held this position until 1914.  In 1906 the Brind brothers changed the name of the company to the British Oxygen Company or BOC as it is better known. The company grew on the development of the oxyacetylene welding process brought out in 1903. In 1969 the name was shortened to BOC the company continued to prosper and in 1978 it acquired Airco Industrial Gases and the enlarged company changed its name to BOC group.  In 2006 the Linde Group made a proposal to acquire the BOC Group and after a second proposal BOC agreed and it became a part of the Linde Group.   The British Oxygen Company was formed from Brin’s Oxygen Company Limited in 1906; they traded from Westminster, London (1912), Edmonton, North London (1920s-30s) & North Wembly, London (1969); in 1975 the company became known as BOC International Limited following national and international growth; in 2006, the German industrial group Linde acquired BOC.

       "    'description': \"Alexander George Thornton may have begun his career in the drawing material trade by becoming apprenticed to W. H. Harling of London.  Between 1874 and 1878, Thornton worked for George Gallie & Sons, booksellers and stationers of Glasgow.  In 1878, he set up a business in Manchester at 8, Albert Square in partnership with Joseph Halden as wholesale drawing material importers and mounted paper manufacturers.  However, this partnership only lasted for a couple of years and Thornton moved to premises of his own at 109, Deansgate.  By the 1890s, these consisted of a single-fronted shop with show rooms, warehouses, and workshops at the rear and in the basement.   The firm soon built up a large national trade and an extensive export business to all parts of the world.  It did a special line in loose drawing instruments which it claimed were the cheapest for their type and quality ever offered.  It also introduced a case of drawing instruments in 1892, which provided good, reliable instruments at a 'convenient price for students and apprentices'.  The company introduced a number of improvements to instruments and equipment such as drawing boards.  By 1895, new designs included rotating compasses, screws for drawing instruments, a miner's dial, fluid transfer ink for drawings or tracings which were to be copied, a typograph copier and a paper stretching board.  In 1897, the firm moved to 11, St. Mary Street with works on Bridge Street and, again in 1904, to Paragon Works on King Street West.  Here there were showrooms, main offices and warehouses, and facilities for mounting hand-made papers and maps.  Manufacture of surveying, drawing and other scientific instruments took place at the Minerva Works on Sidney Street, Salford, purchased in 1907.  During the late 1910s and 1920s, the business expanded quite rapidly due to the growth in demand from colonial and other overseas markets.  In 1912, larger works were acquired in Cross Street off Lloyd Street in Hulme.  The works moved again twelve years later to be split between two premises in Heald Place, Rusholme and North George Street, Salford.  The company also patented several of its own designs of drawing instruments such as beam compasses, drawing curves and dividers.  It used international exhibitions to advertise its products and won medals at the Franco-British Exhibition, London, in 1908 and at the International Exhibition in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1925-6.  By this time, Thornton’s customers included leading universities and colleges and government departments around the world.  During the 1920s, production costs for hand-made drawing instruments increased.  Companies, including A. G. Thornton Ltd., introduced more machine-made instruments using standardised and interchangeable parts. The King Street West premises were destroyed during the Second World War and the various departments were dispersed to different parts of the city: the offices to Gartside Street, export department to Brazenose Street and showrooms to Bridge Street.  In 1949, the company moved to purpose-built premises in the new industrial park on Longley Lane in Northenden.  The retail showroom was retained on Bridge Street in the city centre. A special feature of the new building in Northenden was its dust extraction system to remove dust created by machinery.  By this time, the company had 220 employees, most of whom had been there for many years.  The managing director was  A. M. Thornton, a grandson of the founder.  In March 1967, the company changed its name to British Thornton.  British Thornton itself merged with Education and Science Furniture in January 1992 and moved to Burley.      1880 - Alexander George Thornton set up A G. Thornton Limited as a stationery manufacturer, in Manchester. c1900 - company had expanded, and had begun to produce surveying and scientific equipment. Produced the Jaywess series of drawing instruments, which were their cheapest range and were aimed at technical schools. 1967 - company changed name to British Thornton; 1992 - company merged with ESF\",\n",

In the 1960's Dr Richard Beeching became chairman of the board and started a programme of radical reorganisation. In 1969 British Railways was rebranded and the name British Rail, complete with its double arrow logo, was introduced. In 1993 the company was split into 100 separate parts and privatised under John Major's 1993 Railways Act.  The Transport Act of 2000 finally ended the British Railway Board and its remaining responsibilities were dispersed, though it still remains responsible for the Transport police.\",\n",

The LNER was the second biggest of the the 'Big Four' railway companies formed during grouping.  The group consisted of seven constituent and 26 subsidiary companies. The constituents were North Eastern, Great Northern, Great Eastern, Great Central, Hull & Barnsley, North British and Great North of Scotland. As the name suggests the company covered the arc of the country between north and east of London and included the East Coast Mainline. The main workshops for the company were in Doncaster. // Birth Place: Leeds, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, United Kingdom.\",\n",

Science Museum Library.  19 December 2008  <      Sir Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield was an English electrical engineer, who shared the 1979 Nobel Prize for medicine with Allan Cormack for his pioneering work on the application of computer techniques to X-ray examination of the human body.  Hounsfield and Cormack independently developed the diagnostic technique of computer tomography (CT). In this technique, X-ray readings are taken at all angles by a scanner rotating around the patient. This information is then combined to visualise \\'slices\\' of the human body.   Hounsfield initially tested his prototype head scanner on a preserved human brain, then on a cow\\'s brain sourced from a butcher’s shop, before testing the device on himself. In 1971, CT scanning was applied in medical practice, and by 1975 Hounsfield had built a whole-body scanner.  Today Hounsfield’s name lives on in the ‘Hounsfield Scale’, a quantitative measure of radiodensity used to evaluate CT scans.',\n",

       "    'description': \"Welsh mechanical engineer and inventor, born in Montgomeryshire in 1789. Roberts was a quarryman until the age of 20 before beginning work as a pattern maker at Bradley and Horseley ironworks in 1809. After various jobs a cabinet-maker, turner and toolmaker in Liverpool, Manchester and Salford, he moved to London in 1814 to work for Henry Maudslay as a turner and fitter in mariine and machine tool engineering.     Roberts set up his own business in Deansgate, Manchester, in 1816, producing machine tools. The firm moved in 1818 to Pool Fold, and in 1821 to a larger shop in Faulkner Street, with 12-14 mechanics. In 1823, he went into partnership with Thomas Sharp, which lasted until Sharp's death in 1841.  In 1824 he invented his most famous machine, the self-acting spinning mule, and patented it in March 1825. Roberts made extensive use of templates and gauges to standardise production. The mules were made in hundreds, but Roberts gained little financial reward, having spent so much on its development.   In 1832, Roberts patented six separate improvements in steam locomotion, and built the Atlas works to accommodate locomotive manufacture, for which his firm became renowned.   In the early 1820s Roberts helped to establish the Manchester Mechanics' Institute. He joined the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1823 and was made an honorary member in 1861. He was elected member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1838. From 1838 to 1843 he served on the council of the borough of Manchester.

The LNER was the second biggest of the the 'Big Four' railway companies formed during grouping.  The group consisted of seven constituent and 26 subsidiary companies. The constituents were North Eastern, Great Northern, Great Eastern, Great Central, Hull & Barnsley, North British and Great North of Scotland. As the name suggests the company covered the arc of the country between north and east of London and included the East Coast Mainline.

       "    'description': \"SCM Archive coll;    (1890-1957), aeronautical engineer  Robert Hobart Mayo was born on the 25th September 1890 and was educated at the Perse School and Magdalane College, Cambridge; he showed exceptional abilities in mathematics and mechanical sciences with an inclination towards aeronautics. In 1914 at the early age of 24 he was appointed head of the experimental department at the Royal Aircraft Factory, but soon after the outbreak of war he sought action and served as a Royal Flying Corps pilot in France. Not for long was he permitted to keep his technical brilliance subdued: soon he was brought back to serve as senior commander of the Testing Squadron at Martlesham, and later as head of the Design (Aeroplane) Section, Air Ministry.   In 1925 he was appointed consulting engineer to Imperial Airways, becoming their technical general manager in 1936.  It was during these inter-war years that he gained world-wide recognition as the designer of the Short-Mayo composite aircraft. Its bold principle was the mounting of a very highly loaded aircraft on top of another machine of comparatively light loading, and the release of the former in such a manner that the two components separated cleanly and rapidly in the vertical plane. The upper component was a Short float seaplane, powered with four Napier Rapier engines and named Mercury; the lower was a considerably modified Short Empire-type flying-boat, Maia, with four Bristol Pegasus engines. Normal cruising speed of Mercury was about 180 m.p.h., and a duration of over 21 hours could be achieved. The combination allowed the smaller aircraft to carry a payload of 1,000 lb over a range of 3,500 miles.  After a successful first separation on February 6, 1938, with Capt. J. Lankester Parker flying the lower component and Mr. H. L. Piper the upper, an Atlantic crossing was made in July of that year, Mercury reaching Montreal in 20 hr 20 min in the hands of Capt. (now A.V-M.) D. C. T. Bennett after separation from Maia (flown by Capt. A. S. Wilcockson) over Foynes. Subsequently Mercury made a number of other air-launched flights, on one of which, piloted by Bennett, it established a seaplane record—which still stands—from Scotland to South Africa. On another occasion over a ton of mail was taken non-stop to Alexandria on a routine Imperial Airways flight.  In December 1938, Mayo became technical adviser to Imperial Airways. He was a former chairman of the Records, Racing, and Competitions committee of the Royal Aero Club, a past chairman of the Air League of the British Empire, a member of the National Civil Aviation Consultative Council, and a vice-president of the Federation Aeronautique Internationale. He was also a director of Airtech, Ltd. and Superflexit, Ltd. Mayo died at the age of 66 on the 26th February 1957.   employee of Imperial Airways and later of Short Brothers; inventor of the composite 'Pickaback Craft', an idea later used with space rockets.\",\n",

This led to the creation of the Great Council.  A typical Great Council would consist of archbishops, bishops, abbots, barons and earls as well as the reigning monarch.  The Great Council is recognised as having been the beginnings of the present day House of Lords.  The Anglo saxons also held regular \\'moots\\' in the counties where discussion of local matters were carried out.  The \\'shire moot\\' was attended by the local lords and bishops, the sheriff, and most importantly, four representatives of each village.  After the Conquest, the \\'moots\\' became known as the County Court and formed the basis for the House of Commons.  The Great Council and the County Court gradually evolved into the Parliament of England, becoming known as such in the 13th century.  1215 - King John forced to agree to Magna Carta, the \"great charter\" of legal rights which insisted that he listen to and follow the advice of the barons.  1258 - at the meeting of Parliament at Oxford the barons stated their dissatisfaction with Henry III, and tried to force him to accept a set of conditions called the Provisions of Oxford which called for regular meetings of parliament three times a year.  1707 - the Parliament of England was dissolved following the Acts of Union with Scotland.',\n",

The gallery was founded by Val Williams and husband Andrew Sproxton in November 1972, opening in York with two exhibitions, Butlin's by the Sea by Martin Parr and Daniel Meadows (its first exhibition), and Whitby by Frank Meadow Sutcliffe. In 1976 the gallery moved to Colliergate in York, then moved again to nearby Castlegate in York in 1992. In 2007 the gallery moved to City Park, Bradford.  The gallery is host to a temporary exhibitions programme with on average six exhibitions each year, often solo retrospective shows of mid-career photographers, and also some group shows. The gallery also contains a bookshop and publishes its own books and catalogues, often to accompany its exhibitions, either by itself or in association with others such as Dewi Lewis Publishing and Photoworks.   Independant photography gallery; opened in York in 1972; moved to purpose-built venue in Bradford in 2006.\",\n",

       "    'description': \"ODNB: Rosemary Mitchell, ‘Knight, Charles (1791–1873)’, , 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [, accessed 17 Feb 2012] Charles Knight (1791–1873):      TNA Discovery catalogue:    Charles Knight was born in Windsor in 1791, the son of a bookseller and printer, to whom he was apprenticed in 1805. He worked with his father for three years, learning the print trade. In 1810, Knight founded an unsuccessful reading club for young men in Windsor.  On completion of his apprenticeship in 1812, he became the joint proprietor with his father and the sole editor of the Windsor and Eton Express, the borough's first newspaper.  In 1818 he was appointed as an overseer of the poor.  This role perhaps influenced his denouncement, in 1819, of cheap publications as irreligious and anti-government. Knight called for the provision of more ‘healthful’ literature, and in  1820 he started publication of a monthly serial entitled the Plain Englishman.  This was followed in 1823 by Knight's Quarterly Magazine.  From 1827 Knight was a reader and superintendent for the publications of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK), and the following year he undertook a tour of the midlands industrial towns to organize local committees for the SDUK.  In 1832 Knight began publication of the Penny Magazine, which was aimed primarily at a working-class readership and served up a wholesome diet of informative articles on art, literature, natural history, science, history, and biography (but not politics or religion).  Knight became an early member of the Reform Club in 1834, and in 1837 played a part in the establishment of the penny post.  He became publisher to the General Board of Health in 1853, and in 1855 acted as a juror at the Paris Universal Exhibition. Charles Knight died at Addlestone, Surrey on 9 March 1873. A gateway was erected in his memory at the cemetery adjacent to Bachelors Acre in Windsor, where he was buried.   1803 - was sent to Dr Nicholas's school in Ealing.  1805 - left school to become his father's apprentice, and spent the next three years learning the print trade.  1810 - founded an unsuccessful reading club for young men in Windsor.  1812 - at the completion of his apprenticeship his interests were directed away from his father's business to the expanding press industry and, subsequently, became the joint proprietor with his father and the sole editor of the Windsor and Eton Express, the borough's first newspaper.  1813 - published Arminius, a play.  1818 - appointed as an overseer of the poor.  1819 - denounced cheap publications as irreligious and anti-government, and calling for the provision of more ‘healthful’ literature.  1820 - started publication of a monthly serial entitled the Plain Englishman.  1823 - published Knight's Quarterly Magazine.  1827 - acted as reader and superintendent for the publications of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK).  1828 - undertook a tour of the midlands industrial towns to organize local committees for the SDUK.  1832 - began publication of the Penny Magazine, aimed primarily at a working-class readership and serving up a wholesome diet of informative articles on art, literature, natural history, science, history, and biography (but not politics or religion).  1834 - became an early member of the Reform Club.  1837 - played a part in the establishment of the penny post.  1850 - was publisher to the General Board of Health.  1855 - acted as a juror at the Paris Universal Exhibition.\",\n",

The first Ensign logo was a shop sign with the letter 'N' inside, and was replaced in 1911 by the name ENSIGN written inside the British marine flag. Also in the early 1900s the company built a factory for the production of cameras on the Fulbourn Road in Walthamstow, which by 1908 this was the biggest British camera factory.\",\n",

       "    'description': '; ;       The Psychological Corporation (1921) Psychologist James McKeen Cattell founded The Psychological Corporation in New York in 1921. Cattell was a leading figure in psychology and was the president of the American Psychological Association, as well as founder and editor of Scientific Monthly and head of Columbia University’s psychology department. At age 60, when Columbia dismissed him because of his public opposition to the draft in World War I, Cattell decided to pursue his interest in publishing. He joined forces with two former graduate students, Robert Sessions Woodworth and Edward Lee Thorndike.  Both were eminent psychologists, and Thorndike was regarded as the foremost authority on the analysis and measurement of learning. The three men started a business to market psychological tests and related materials to educational, corporate and government clients. In 1939, the company published the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scales. David Wechsler was a former student of Woodworth at Columbia University. The company’s Wechsler intelligence tests continue to be industry leaders today. In 1970, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich acquired The Psychological Corporation and, in 1976, merged its educational testing department, acquired from World Book Company in 1960, into The Psychological Corporation. This new organizational structure leveraged the strengths of the two assessment product lines – individually administered psychological assessments and group administered educational measurements. In the 1980s and 1990s, The Psychological Corporation (TPC) expanded through a number of acquisitions. In 1986, the company acquired Merrill Publishing’s test division with its portfolio of tests for language, speech and hearing. In 1993, it acquired Cognitronics Corporation. In 1994, the company acquired Communication Skill Builders/Therapy Skill Builders and its therapy products for speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists and physical therapists. In 1983, The Psychological Corporation moved from New York to Cleveland. When the company moved to San Antonio, Texas, in 1985, it established its own operational services, including customer service, warehouse, distribution, information technology, scoring and reporting services. In order to establish a stronger identity for its educational assessment products, and to link them more closely to the Harcourt name, The Psychological Corporation’s education testing unit was branded as Harcourt Brace Educational Measurement in 1995. The name was shortened in 1999 to Harcourt Educational Measurement.  Harcourt General, Harcourt, Inc. and Harcourt Assessment, Inc.  In 1991, General Cinema Corporation, a diversified company that operated retailers such as Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, as well as a national chain of movie theaters, acquired Harcourt Brace Jovanovich for more than $1.5 billion. In 1993, General Cinema Corporation renamed itself Harcourt General and restored the publishing division’s name to the historic Harcourt Brace & Company. At the end of the year, Harcourt General divested its cinema division.  In 1999, Harcourt General divested its retail division and shortened the publishing division’s name to Harcourt, Inc. That same year, Harcourt, Inc. adopted the brand name Harcourt Assessment for its testing businesses. At the time, Harcourt Assessment comprised The Psychological Corporation, which was known as the clinical division, and Harcourt Educational Measurement, which was known as the education division.  In late 2003, the testing business legally changed its name to Harcourt Assessment, Inc., and unified its two divisions into one operating company.  The company retired the two division names – Harcourt Educational Measurement and The Psychological Corporation – although it retained “PsychCorp” as a brand imprint for select products.   2008: part of the Pearson group',\n",

Gruber, ‘Hunter, John (1728–1793)’, , Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2006 [] John Hunter (1728–1793):       Born into a large family based near Glasgow, John Hunter went to London in 1748 to work with his brother William (1718-83), a successful obstetrician and physician. He showed an aptitude for anatomical work and also for securing a supply of corpses for dissection; he was probably present at the dissection of more than two thousand human bodies during the 12 years he spent working with his brother. William ensured that his younger brother received training despite his lack of formal education. John Hunter entered St George's Hospital as a surgical pupil in 1754. He signed up as an army surgeon in 1760 and over two years gained much experience in managing wounds. He returned to London in 1763, where, hampered by a lack of formal apprenticeship, he found it difficult to establish a practice and so he worked in dentistry. He was finally admitted to the Company of Surgeons in 1768, after which he established a large practice and trained students, including Edward Jenner (1749-1823). Hunter wrote several books, including one on venereal disease which was the first text to discuss venereal disease in a non-judgmental manner. He was rumoured to have inoculated himself with gonorrhoea as an experiment while writing the book. Hunter also performed many experiments on animals. When he became surgeon to King George III in 1776 he had access to the king's menagerie. When the king's elephant died Hunter performed the first dissection of an elephant. In 1783 he set up his own museum, which housed five thousand wet preparations, three thousand stuffed or dried animals, 1200 fossils, nearly a thousand osteology specimens and almost a thousand diseased organs\",\n",

It had a period of expansion and acquistions which included the Scottish Central Railway (1865), the Scottish North Eastern Railway (1866), Wemyss Bay-Port Glasgow Railway (1893)  The company was absorbed in the grouping of 1923 into the London, Midland and Scottish railway however unlike most other groupings which took place on January 1st 1923, the amalgamation of the Caledonian Railway was not finalised until the 1st July that year because of legal complications\",\n",

The line opened in 1849 and was soon providing services from Carlisle to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Greenhill (near Falkirk). The first engineer for the company was Joseph Locke. It had a period of expansion and acquistions which included the Scottish Central Railway (1865), the Scottish North Eastern Railway (1866), Wemyss Bay-Port Glasgow Railway (1893)  The company was absorbed in the grouping of 1923 into the London, Midland and Scottish railway however unlike most other groupings which took place on January 1st 1923, the amalgamation of the Caledonian Railway was not finalised until the 1st July that year because of legal complications\",\n",

In 1969 British Railways was rebranded and the name British Rail, complete with its double arrow logo, was introduced. In 1993 the company was split into 100 separate parts and privatised under John Major's 1993 Railways Act.  The Transport Act of 2000 finally ended the British Railway Board and its remaining responsibilities were dispersed, though it still remains responsible for the Transport police.\",\n",

His shop there was known as the 'Cross Daggers, next door to the Pope's Head Tavern near Benthlem Gate in Moorfield'  but he also had another workshop situated in Cornhill, also in London. Hayes used the depiction of crossed daggers as his shop sign and in the printed advertisements he made from the 1650s.  Primarily a maker of mathematical instruments made from silver, brass and wood, Hayes was a skilled engraver and took many apprentices during his three decades of instrument making including Edmund Culpeper. There is evidence that Hayes also operated as a book-seller on behalf of others, and some of the books that he sold may have accompanied, or were linked to, the mathematical implements that he sold.  A member of the Grocer's Guild, Hayes' instruments included quadrants, astrolabes, protractors and other measuring tools. In addition to engraving his name on objects, in some cases he engraved a stylised monogram to indicate he was the maker and this may have been a form of early modern branding. He is thought to have died in either 1695 or 1696.\",\n",

Previously the Meter Department of GEC it was incorporated at the same time as the newly formed Connor-Peel Telephone Company, both of the businesses shared the same premises at Bow Street Works. The two companies were also wholly owned subsidiarys of GEC.  Salford Electrical Instruments Ltd eventually took over the whole of the building when a ten acre plot of land was purchased in Stoke, Coventry for the construction of a magneto works. Once the factory had been established a further 136 acres was purchased and construction of the factory on the new site was completed by 1921, this enabled Salford Electrical Instruments Ltd to occupy the whole of the Peel Works from then on.  In the early Nineties the company had been experiencing trading difficulties and had sold off various interests including its Magnetic Materials to Neoside Limited and Mining Product business to Rowe Hankins Components Ltd in 1993. The company also sold the crystals division to Plessey Semiconductors in August 1993, which left it to concentrate on products for the automotive industry, eventually relocating to Portsmouth in June, 1993. On the 22nd December 1993 the land and buildings along with all other assets were transferred to the General Electric Company, plc. Eventually GEC merged with British Aerospace Engineering to form BAE Systems in 1999.  As a consequence of this Salford Electrical Instruments Ltd became part of this group, although is now effectively a dormant company, as it is not trading under its own account.   Traded at Silk St., Salford, Manchester, England (1930s-1990).  Formerly part of the GEC group they were taken over by Sailcrest Engineers Ltd., who now (2007) trade as Sailcrest Magntics Ltd.\",\n",

In 1993 the company was split into 100 separate parts and privatised under John Major's 1993 Railways Act.

       "    'description': \"Rutherford was born in 1871 in Nelson, New Zealand.  He had a good understanding of maths and did original work on radio waves at Canterbury College, Christchurch.  He won a scholarship to go to the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, where J. J. Thompson, who had discovered the electron, supervised him.  Rutherford studied the conduction of electricity through gases and discovered alpha and beta particles.  Soon he was offered a professorship at McGill University, Montreal and had enough money to marry his childhood sweetheart, Mary Newton.  In Montreal, with Frederick Soddy, he showed that radioactivity was a process in which atoms of one element decayed spontaneously into atoms of another.   The scientific community was impressed and Rutherford was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.  In 1907, he was invited to take over the chair of physics at the University of Manchester, at the express wish of the outgoing Professor, Arthur Schuster. In 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, researchers working with Rutherford at Manchester, bombarded gold foil with alpha particles from helium nuclei.  Most of the particles went straight through as expected but a few bounced back.  Rutherford was astounded, remarking: 'It was as though you had fired a fifteen-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it had bounced back and hit you.'  In 1911, to explain this, Rutherford proposed a new structure for the atom. He imagined the atom as a miniature solar system with a nucleus at its centre and electrons orbiting around.  Although the nucleus was only a million-millionth the volume of the atom, it had over 99.9% of the mass.  The nucleus also had a positive electric charge to balance the negative electric charge of the electrons around it.  Rutherford was knighted in the 1914 New Year’s Honours List.  Work on radiation ceased during the First World War and Rutherford led the Allied research into the detection of submarines.  However, in 1917 Rutherford and his technician, William Kay, set up an experiment using alpha particles as projectiles with which to hit nitrogen atoms.  In a long series of exhausting tests, they showed that the result was the liberation of the nucleus of a hydrogen atom.  Rutherford had achieved the transmutation of one element into another.  Surprisingly, there was very little interest in either the scientific or popular press when he published his results in 1919.  Soon after, he moved to head the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge.  There, he worked out ways of accelerating particles so that they could be used to explore the secret recesses of matter.  He became President of the Royal Society in 1925 and Lord Rutherford in 1931.  His researchers carried out further important work: in 1932, James Chadwick found the neutron, and John Cockroft and Ernest Walton transformed lithium atoms into helium by bombarding them with protons.  By then, nuclear research was becoming an activity that required teams of researchers and highly specialised, expensive equipment.  Rutherford died suddenly on 19 October 1937 and was buried at Westminster Abbey.   (1871-1937) Baron Rutherford of Nelson, physicist  Ernest Rutherford was born on the 30th August 1871 in New Zealand where he was educated and brought up until 1895. In 1889 he was awarded a University scholarship and he proceeded to the University of New Zealand, Wellington, where he entered Canterbury College. He received a double first in Mathematics and Physical Science and he continued with research work at the College for a short time, receiving the B.Sc. degree the following year. In 1894 Rutherford went to Trinity College Cambridge as a research student. Here, Rutherford discovered that placing uranium near foil resulted in one type of radiation being easily soaked up or blocked, while a different type had no trouble penetrating the same foil. He labeled the two radiation types “alpha” and “beta.” As it turns out, the alpha particle was identical to the nucleus of a helium atom. The beta particle was, in fact, the same as an electron or positron.  In 1898 he went to Canada as the Macdonald Chair of Physics at McGill University, Montreal. Here, achieving fame for his contributions to the understanding of radioelements, Rutherford became an active public speaker, published numerous magazine articles and wrote the most highly regarded textbook of the time on radioactivity.  In 1907 Rutherford returned to England and became Langworthy Professor of Physics in the University of Manchester. Through further experimentation involving firing alpha particles at foil, Rutherford made the groundbreaking discovery that nearly the total mass of an atom is concentrated in a nucleus. In so doing, he gave birth to the nuclear model, a discovery that marked the inception of nuclear physics and ultimately paved the way to the invention of the atom bomb. Aptly dubbed the “Father of the Nuclear Age,” Rutherford received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1908. By 1919 he had made another monumental discovery: how to artificially induce a nuclear reaction in a stable element. Nuclear reactions were Rutherford’s main focus for the rest of his scientific career.  Rutherford was knighted in 1914; he was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1925, and in 1931 he was created First Baron Rutherford of Nelson, New Zealand, and Cambridge. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1903 and was its President from 1925 to 1930. He died in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 19 October 1937 of complications following an operation for a strangulated hernia\",\n",

       "    'description': \"William Henry Perkin was born in 1838.  His father was a builder and wanted his son to become an architect.  However, when William was 12 years old, a friend showed him how soda and alum crystallise. This started his interest in science, which disappointed his father, who was concerned that this would not offer good career prospects.   At the age of 14 he began to attend the City of London School.  The school was one of the first in England to teach chemistry as a practical subject. Perkin was taught chemistry and physics by Thomas Hall.  He quickly made progress and was allowed to assist Hall in setting up experiments for lectures. Hall encouraged him in his interest and introduced him to August Wilhelm von Hofmann, who ran the Royal College of Chemistry.  Perkin enrolled at the Royal College when he was 16.  The College later became the Royal College of Science and, in 1907, was one of the founding bodies of Imperial College.  At the age of 17, Perkin became Hofmann’s research assistant.  Hofmann was keen to develop a synthetic form of quinine, an expensive natural extract that was in demand as a treatment for malaria.  Perkin continued to work on this in a rudimentary laboratory at home during the evenings and at weekends.  During the Easter vacation of 1856, Perkin was experimenting with aniline, a colourless aromatic oil derived from coal tar. While trying to oxidise aniline using potassium dichromate, Perkin made a black precipitate. He tried to remove the colour and found that the resulting solution would turn silk purple.    Perkin named the colour mauve and the dye mauveine.  He decided to try to market his discovery instead of returning to college.   On 26 August 1856, the Patent Office granted Perkin a patent for 'a new colouring matter for dyeing with a lilac or purple colour stuffs of silk, cotton, wool, or other materials’.  Perkin's next step was to interest cloth dyers and printers in his discovery.  He had no experience of the textile trade and little knowledge of large-scale chemical manufacture.  He corresponded with Robert and John Pullar in Glasgow, who offered him support. Perkin's luck changed towards the end of 1857 when the Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, decided that mauve was the colour to wear.  In January 1858 Queen Victoria followed suit, wearing mauve to her daughter’s wedding.  Perkin’s success was assured, as he was the only person in Britain who could produce the colour in any quantity.  Perkin’s father and elder brother supported his venture.  His father used his savings to build a factory at Greenford Green, near Harrow, Middlesex.  By December 1857, Perkin and Sons began supplying mauve to silk dyers.   Perkin went on to work on other aniline-based dyes, including a synthetic version of alizarin, a red dye extracted from the madder plant.  His company continued to be successful. In 1874, at the age of only 36, Perkin sold the factory and retired from industry.  He built on his reputation as a chemist, devoting his time to carrying out research at home.  In 1906, Perkin was awarded a knighthood.   Sir William Henry Perkin was born on 12 March 1838 in Shadwell, London. In 1851 he was sent to the City of London School, and in 1853 he entered the Royal College of Chemistry as a student under August Wilhelm Hofmann.   In 1856 Perkin attempted, to synthesize quinine by oxidizing a salt of allyltoluidine with potassium dichromate. The experiment failed. On repeating the method with aniline instead of the toluidine derivative, he obtained on a purple-coloured solution which was the first aniline or coal-tar dye to be discovered. Perkin filed a patent for this process in 1856.   He then resigned his position at the Royal College of Chemistry and in 1858 opened a chemical factory at Greenford Green, London. Perkin's discovery and manufacture of the first aniline dye eventually led to the displacement of natural by artificial dyestuffs, also made from various coal-tar products.   He was knighted in 1906 and died at his home in Sudbury on 14 July 1907.   William Henry Perkin was born in 1838.  His father was a builder and wanted his son to become an architect.

In recognition of his contributions to science, Perkin was elected to the Royal Society in 1866 and knighted in 1906. His enterprise was important because it helped to establish the modern chemical industry. Many other companies were founded, encouraged by Perkin's success; they adopted his new methods of chemical synthesis on a large scale. While Perkin's own effort to produce a medical substance failed, work such as his was crucial for the establishment of the pharmaceutical industry.\",\n",

In 1904 he opened a small factory in Glasgow after the General Post Office (GPO) placed an order for his machines and remained there until 1909 when he and some of the workforce moved to Croydon.  In 1912 along with another Danish engineer Harald Bille the company was incorporated as Creed, Bille & Company Limited. Unfortunately Harald Bille was killed in a railway accident and his name was eventually dropped from the company name. Frederick also developed the receiving end of the system that enabled the electronic messages to be received and punched out on paper tape. A printer received the tape and decoded the message back into plain language this became known as the \"Creed High Speed Automatic Printing Telegraphy System\".  The Daily Mail realised the potential of his system in sending news around the country and it was not long before they were sending the entire contents of the Daily Mail between London and Manchester. Because of the continued growth of the company the company outgrew its original premises on Selsdon Road and moved to Telegraph House in 1915.  Creed and Company Limited eventually became part of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation in July 1928.   In 1912 along with another Danish engineer Harald Bille the company was incorporated as Creed, Bille & Company Limited. Unfortunately Harald Bille was killed in a railway accident and his named was eventually dropped from the company name.

This model of an express passenger locomotive for the London and South Western Railway. The full-size locomotive, from which this model is copied, was designed by William Adams in 1890. It was built at the LSWR's Nine Elms works. This class of locomotive was still in use 50 years later, latterly on local trains. The model-making firm of T. H. and C. J. Coates built the model to a commission from the Science Museum. Together with a third brother, the model-makers worked on this model 14 hours a day for one year and nine months. As far as possible the details are exactly to scale, using the same kind of materials as on the original locomotive. Dimensions were obtained both from the LSWR's working drawings and from details on the actual locomotives. The model of the locomotive was completed in 1896 and the tender in 1899.\",\n",

Web. 17 Jan. 2011. <  Introduced field hospitals, ambulance service, and first-aid practices to the battlefield.      Dominique Larrey was Surgeon-in-Chief of the Napoleonic armies from 1797 to 1815. Orphaned at the age of 13, Larrey moved from the Pyrenees in the south of France to Paris, to study medicine. He then served in the navy and army, introducing many new innovations in military surgery.  From the 1700s it was increasingly clear that wounded soldiers needed to be moved away from the battlefield as soon as possible. Otherwise their chances of survival were small. In 1792, Larrey was inspired by seeing weapons mounted on wheels, which meant they could be moved quickly and avoid capture by the enemy. Larrey designed what he called flying ambulances, which were horse-drawn carriages that would take four to six casualties lying down. They were staffed by experienced drivers and stretcher-bearers. Larrey was resourceful; when there was insufficient transport after a battle he commandeered the local wheelbarrows and had civilians push the wounded soldiers to a hospital.  Larrey also improved the mobility of the field hospitals and organised a system of triage, under which the wounded were treated according to their need for treatment and not because they were of noble birth.',\n",
