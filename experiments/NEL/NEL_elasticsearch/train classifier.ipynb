       "      <td>GEC Traction (GECT) was formed in 1972 as part of the GEC Power Engineering Group following earlier amalgamations of the traction divisions of the General Electric Company (GEC), the English Electric Company (EE) and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI).  A wholly owned subsidiary company of GEC, the company had offices and works, located at Trafford Park in Manchester, at Strand Road in Preston, and at Attercliffe Common, Sheffield.   The headquarters of GEC Traction was Trafford Park, Manchester (previously the headquarters of English Electric-AEI Traction) with design of rotating machines at Preston and Sheffield, and manufacturing activities for control equipment at Manchester and Preston.  GEC Traction designed and manufactured a full range of traction machines and control equipment for electric vehicles, including electric locomotives and multiple unit trains for main-line and mass-transit railway systems (dc up to 3,000 volts, and ac up to 50,000 volts), diesel-electric locomotives and trains, mining and industrial locomotives, tramcars and trolleybuses.  GEC Traction was the leading supplier of traction equipment in the UK and had a wide market around the world, particularly in South Africa, Australasia, Hong Kong, South Korea, South America and Pakistan.  In 1979 the Industrial Locomotive Division of the former English Electric which was based at Vulcan Works, Newton-le-Willows was merged into GEC Traction, which later became a separate company, GEC Industrial Locomotives Ltd.  During the late 1980s and 1990s the firm underwent major rationalisation, involving closure of several sites including Attercliffe Common in Sheffield in 1985 and the company’s headquarters at Trafford Park in Manchester in 1998.  The company name GEC Traction endured until a merger with the French Alsthom group in 1989, which created GEC Alsthom Traction, which was still a branch of the main company GEC Alsthom.</td>\n",

When he was fifteen, Ackermann was apprenticed to his elder brother Friedrich, a saddler. During his apprenticeship, he also learned to draw and engrave. In 1782 started training as a carriage designer, first in Dresden and then at Hueningen, in Switzerland. In 1784 he was employed for six months by Antoine Carassi in Paris. He worked for the carriage maker Simons in Brussels in 1785–6. He moved to England in 1787, where his model of a state coach for the carriage maker Goodall led to his first important commission in 1790, to design a state coach for the lord lieutenant of Ireland. Between 1791 and 1820 he published thirteen books of designs for carriages.   Ackermann formed close connections with other émigrés from Saxony, most significantly with the Facius brothers and with J. C. Stadler, who worked as engravers for the leading print publisher John Boydell. From 1795-1805, he ran a drawing school in Strand, and in 1796 he published the first of many drawing books. In 1797, he began publishing decorative hand-coloured prints.  During the first decade of the 19th century, Ackermann continued to design state and other carriages.  He became a United Kingdom citizen on 24 March 1809.  In 1808 and 1809, Ackermann issued two publications which secured his reputation as a publisher of the finest colour plate books: The Microcosm of London, and the monthly magazine Repository of Arts. Ackermann employed the architectural draughtsman Augustus Pugin, and the figure drawer Thomas Rowlandson to provide illustrations and architectural drawings for his engravings.  Ackermann formally handed over his business, Ackermann &amp; Co, to his younger sons in October 1832. He suffered a stroke in November 1833 and died on 30 March 1834 at his home at Cold Harbour, Finchley.   1825: established in a print shop at 191 Regent Street, London</td>\n",

       "      <td>“British Railways” is the expression commonly used to describe the business run by the following legal entities:  • Railway Executive (1948 – 1952) • British Transport Commission (1952 – 1963) • British Railways Board (1963 – 1993)  Railways were nationalised on 1st January 1948 when the assets of the railways in Great Britain were vested in the British Transport Commission (BTC), a state-owned corporation created by the Transport Act 1947.  Between 1948 and 1952 the business of operating the railways was carried on by the Railway Executive, a state-owned corporation, subsidiary to BTC.  The Railway Executive was abolished in 1952 and BTC took over direct responsibility for the railways.  Before 1948 there was no brand that was identified with the whole of the railways of Great Britain, only the separate brands of the Group companies, Southern, Great Western, London, Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern, and London Transport.  The railways were run under the corporate identity “British Railways” from 1948 by both the Railway Executive and BTC.  The public manifestations of this were the words themselves on vehicles and premises, quasi-heraldic devices on locomotives (the so-called “cycling lion” followed by the “ferret and dartboard”) and the lozenge shape adopted (and clearly inspired by London Transport’s very similar logo) for station names.  When the nationalised transport industry was reorganised in 1963, BTC was itself abolished and a new statutory corporation created to run the railways.  This was British Railways Board (BRB).  The name most closely associated with the national railway system had now become part of the name of the corporate entity, (i.e. the legal person, entitled as a matter of law to own property, to enter into contracts, and to sue (or be sued) in the courts and be prosecuted for breaches of the criminal law) which owned the assets and business of the railways of Great Britain.  As a result of the corporate rebranding carried out in 1965 the business name, or brand name (as it was now expressly recognised to be), was shortened to “British Rail”.  However, BRB retained the full “British Railways” in its title until its eventual abolition under the provisions of the Transport Act 2000.</td>\n",

       "      <td>GEC Traction (GECT) was formed in 1972 as part of the GEC Power Engineering Group following earlier amalgamations of the traction divisions of the General Electric Company (GEC), the English Electric Company (EE) and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI).  A wholly owned subsidiary company of GEC, the company had offices and works, located at Trafford Park in Manchester, at Strand Road in Preston, and at Attercliffe Common, Sheffield.   The headquarters of GEC Traction was Trafford Park, Manchester (previously the headquarters of English Electric-AEI Traction) with design of rotating machines at Preston and Sheffield, and manufacturing activities for control equipment at Manchester and Preston.  GEC Traction designed and manufactured a full range of traction machines and control equipment for electric vehicles, including electric locomotives and multiple unit trains for main-line and mass-transit railway systems (dc up to 3,000 volts, and ac up to 50,000 volts), diesel-electric locomotives and trains, mining and industrial locomotives, tramcars and trolleybuses.  GEC Traction was the leading supplier of traction equipment in the UK and had a wide market around the world, particularly in South Africa, Australasia, Hong Kong, South Korea, South America and Pakistan.  In 1979 the Industrial Locomotive Division of the former English Electric which was based at Vulcan Works, Newton-le-Willows was merged into GEC Traction, which later became a separate company, GEC Industrial Locomotives Ltd.  During the late 1980s and 1990s the firm underwent major rationalisation, involving closure of several sites including Attercliffe Common in Sheffield in 1985 and the company’s headquarters at Trafford Park in Manchester in 1998.  The company name GEC Traction endured until a merger with the French Alsthom group in 1989, which created GEC Alsthom Traction, which was still a branch of the main company GEC Alsthom.</td>\n",

       "      <td>1947-1962  The Transport Act 1947 nationalised virtually all British transport, including the railways, waterways, and road haulage. These were transferred to a newly-created operating body, the British Transport Commission (BTC). The British Transport Commission began operations on 1st January 1948, under Chairman Sir (later Lord) Cyril Hurcomb. At this time, the British Transport Commission acquired the “Big Four” grouped railways, with virtually all minor railways as well, together with the London Passenger Transport Board. This automatically transferred the assets of the rail companies to BTC, including ships, ports, hotels, and investments in bus, coach, and haulage companies. Two bus companies, Tilling and Scottish Motor Traction, were soon added, as well as long-distance road hauliers. The Transport Act charged the British Transport Commission with the task of charged with “integrating” various forms of transport into single public service.   The British Transport Commission did not directly operate transport services. Operations were delegated to five separately appointed executives: Docks and Inland Waterways, Hotels, London Transport, Road Transport, and Railways. The Railways Executive operated under the name British Railways. In 1949, the Road Transport Executive was divided into two separate executives: Road Haulage and Road Passenger. The Commission exercised financial control over these Executives, and managed them through schemes of delegation.   The Commission attempted to fulfil its statutory duty to “integrate” public transport by introducing Area Schemes. These were designed to establish regional monopolies for road passenger transport, ports, and harbours. “Integration” was also to be promoted through Charges Schemes, in which the true costs of different modes of transport were to be reflected in the charges. This was designed to attract traffic to the most economic and efficient mode of transport.   The structure of Executives was dramatically altered by the Transport Act 1953, which abolished all Executives, with the exception of London Transport. Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of transport systems was delegated to the chief regional managers. The railways were reorganised into a system of area boards for each of its six regions. In September 1953, Sir Brian Robertson became Chairman. Disposal of the haulage fleet also began at this time, but a lack of buyers made this difficult.   Rising costs, industrial action and competition from road traffic meant that the British Transport Commission was in financial trouble by 1955. It sought relief from this by publishing The Modernisation and Re-equipment of British Railways, a plan which proposed an investment in the railways of £1,240m over fifteen years. The main features of this plan were the replacement of steam with electric and diesel traction, the electrification of principle routes, and the introduction of new coaching stock.   Despite the modernisation plan, the financial position of the British Transport Commission worsened. Two government reviews, in 1956 and 1959, concluded that the Commission was unwieldy and had an insufficiently commercial outlook.   Sir Brian Robertson retired in May 1961, and was replaced by Dr Richard Beeching.   The BTC was abolished by the Transport Act 1962. It was replaced with five new authorities that were answerable to the Minister of Transport: the British Railways Board, the British Transport Docks Board, the British Waterways Board, the London Transport Board, and the Transport Holding Company. Dr Beeching became chair of the British Railways Board.   Created during nationalisation but ran into financial difficulties in the late 1950's. It was abolished by the 1962 Transport Act when British Railways Board was created to replace it.</td>\n",

Roe’s aeronautical inventions and experiments and went on to be of paramount importance to the training of air force officers. In 1918, Humphrey Verdon-Roe married Dr. Marie C.

       "      <td>Aircraft designer and manufacturer, born in 1877 in Patricroft, Manchester, known as Alliott Verdon-Roe.   Roe left school at fifteen and in 1893 he became an apprentice at the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway locomotive works, afterwards studying marine engineering at King's College, London. In 1899 he joined the British and South African Royal Mail Company.   During his last voyage in 1902, he became fascinated with flight and began making flying models in his spare time. In 1907 Roe won £75 in a model aeroplane competition. He used the money to build a full-sized copy of his model. After fitting a more powerful engine in 1908, he managed a number of short flights at Brooklands; this was the first time a British designed and built aeroplane had flown.   In January 1910 his brother, Humphrey Verdon Roe helped to found A. V. Roe &amp; Co. in Manchester. In 1911 he designed the first enclosed cabin aeroplane, which flew in 1912 and was entered in the British military trials that year. In October 1912 it established a British flying record of seven and a half hours.  In the following year Roe designed and built the famous Avro 504 which became the best-known military aeroplane of the First World War. An Avro 504 carried out a raid on the Zeppelin sheds at Friedrichshafen on 21 November 1914, which was the first air raid in the history of warfare. The plane was revolutionary in its design and in 1917 it became the standard trainer and for a quarter of a century.   Business declined after the war and Roe sold the controlling interest in A. V. Roe &amp; Co. to the Armstrong Siddeley Motor Company in 1928. Roe and two other investors bought an interest in the boat builder Saunders Ltd, of Cowes. The name was changed to Saunders-Roe and Roe remained president of the company for the rest of his life.  Alliott Roe was knighted in 1929n 8 June 1928. He restyled his name to Verdon-Roe in 1933. He died at St Mary's Hospital, Portsmouth, on 4 January 1958.  Born 1877-04-26.</td>\n",

In most respects it is a typical example of a locomotive of about 1900.  This was one of the first superheated engines built by Vulcan, which first supplied locomotives with Phoenix smokebox superheaters to the North West India Railway in 1911.

It initially produced girders for bridges, switches and crossings, and other ironwork following the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Because of the distance from the locomotive works in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, it seemed preferable to build and support them locally. In 1832, Robert Stephenson became a partner for a few years. The company had become The Vulcan Foundry Company in 1847 and acquired limited liability in 1864. From the beginning of 1898, the name changed again to the The Vulcan Foundry Limited, dropping the word 'company.'  In 1944 the Vulcan Foundry acquired Robert Stephenson and Hawthornes Limited and in 1945 received a large order for 2-8-0 locomotives for UNRRA in Europe. The factory gradually changed over to diesel and electric production and in 1955 became part of the English Electric group. Under the new ownership, the works has produced many locomotives for both domestic and foreign railways, notably the Deltic.   The factory passed through various hands firstly as GEC Alsthom then Alstom, and finally as part of MAN B&amp;W Diesel in 2000. At the end of 2002 the works closed. It was then an industrial estate (appropriately called \"Vulcan Industrial Estate\"). The site was just North of Winwick Junction where the line to Newton Le Willows branches off to the west from the West Coast Main Line. All buildings on the site were demolished in October 2007. Founded in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens, Merseyside, England, United Kingdom.</td>\n",

       "      <td>(1771-1833), Engineer  Born in 1771 in Cornwall, Richard Trevithick was a practical engineer who developed high pressure steam engines. In 1800 he built the first of the double-acting stationary engine which was the forerunner of the famous ‘Cornish engines’. Between 1801 and 1803 he built three steam-powered road locomotives. In 1803 he built the first practical railway locomotive, a tram engine for Coalbrookdale. After that he constructed the ‘Pen-y-darren’ locomotive for Samuel Homfray, partner in the ‘Pen-y-darren Tramway’ in south Wales. Although this was not a success due to the quality of the track rather than the locomotive, it was a proof of principle. Trevithick built two more railway locomotives: one in Gateshead in 1805, possibly for the Wylam Waggon Way (which was again let down by the poor quality of the rails), and, in 1808, the ‘Catch me who Can’, for an exhibition in London. He is also important for demonstrating that a smooth wheel running on smooth iron rails was capable of hauling considerable loads.  He was involved in the unsuccessful project to drive a tunnel under the Thames from Rotherhithe. In 1816 he left his family and went to South America where he was involved in mining ventures in Peru. These also were ultimately unsuccessful, in part due to the wars of independence, and Trevithick returned, penniless, to England in 1827. Despite the setbacks he experienced, Trevithick’s inventive capacity was undiminished. His last patent was granted in 1832. He went to work for J. Hall in Dartford where he died on 22nd April 1833.  He was married to Jane Harvey (1772 – 1868/9), daughter of another Cornish engineer, John Harvey of Hayle Foundry and had six children, Francis and Frederick Henry, who both became engineers, and Richard, John, Ann and Elizabeth. Born 1771-04-13. Died 1833-04-22.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Impressions Gallery is an independent and not-for-profit contemporary photography gallery space in Bradford, England. The gallery was founded by Val Williams and husband Andrew Sproxton in November 1972, opening in York with two exhibitions, Butlin's by the Sea by Martin Parr and Daniel Meadows (its first exhibition), and Whitby by Frank Meadow Sutcliffe. In 1976 the gallery moved to Colliergate in York, then moved again to nearby Castlegate in York in 1992. In 2007 the gallery moved to City Park, Bradford.  The gallery is host to a temporary exhibitions programme with on average six exhibitions each year, often solo retrospective shows of mid-career photographers, and also some group shows. The gallery also contains a bookshop and publishes its own books and catalogues, often to accompany its exhibitions, either by itself or in association with others such as Dewi Lewis Publishing and Photoworks.   Independant photography gallery; opened in York in 1972; moved to purpose-built venue in Bradford in 2006.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The General Electric Company (GEC) was created as the General Electric Apparatus Company in 1886 by Hugo Hirst and Gustav Byng from a small electrical business established in London by Byng (Gustav Binswanger and Company, using Byng's original name).  In 1887 GEC published the first electrical catalogue of its kind.  The following year the company acquired its first factory in Manchester where telephones, electric bells, ceiling roses and switches were manufactured.  In 1889, the General Electric Co. Ltd. was formed as a private limited company and moved to larger premises at 71, Queen Victoria Street.  Now known also as G.E.C., the company was expanding rapidly, opening new branches and factories.  Initially manufacture was focussed on electric bells and light fittings, but this expanded to a wide range of electrical equipment - resulting in the firm's slogan 'Everything Electrical'.  In 1893, GEC decided to invest in lamp manufacture. The resulting company, (to become Osram in 1909), was to lead the way in lamp design and the burgeoning demand for electric lighting was to make GEC's fortune.  In 1900, GEC was incorporated as a public limited company, The General Electric Company (1900) Ltd, (the '1900' was dropped three years later).    In 1902, GEC's first purpose-built factory, the Witton Engineering Works was opened near Birmingham which designed and manufactured electrical equipment and machines.  Rapidly growing private and commercial use of electricity ensured buoyant demand and the company expanded both at home and overseas, with the establishment of agencies in Europe, Japan, Australia, South Africa and India and a substantial export trade to South America.  The outbreak of the First World War transformed GEC into a major player in the electrical industry with profits to match.  The company was heavily involved in the war effort, with products such as radios, signalling lamps and arc-lamp carbons.  Between the wars, GEC expanded to become an international corporation and a national institution. The take-over of Fraser and Chalmers in 1918 took GEC into heavy engineering and consolidated their claim to supply 'Everything Electrical'.  Other major factories included Osram Lamps at Hammersmith and the telephone works in Coventry.  During the 1920s, the company was heavily involved in the creation of the UK national grid.  In addition, the opening of the new purpose built company headquarters in Kingsway, London in 1921, and the pioneering industrial research laboratories at Wembley in 1923, were symbolic of the continuing expansion of both GEC and the electrical industry.  The company took over several companies in the Birmingham area and elsewhere.  After being a minor player in tram equipment, the company entered the heavy rail electric traction market in the 1920’s and 30’s.  During the Second World War, GEC was a major supplier to the military of electrical and engineering products.  Significant contributions to the war effort included the development of the cavity magnetron for radar, advances in communications technology and the on-going mass production of lamps and lighting equipment.  After the war the company continued in the full range of electrical equipment from electronics to atomic power stations, but was not very profitable.  In 1961, after a failed takeover bid from the English Electric Company, GEC took over Radio and Allied Industries, a small but very profitable television set manufacturer.  Michael Sobell and Arnold Weinstock from this company became GEC directors with a substantial shareholding.  Weinstock became managing director in 1963 and undertook drastic changes to make the company more profitable.  The rail traction operations were closed and the heavy electrical/ power station businesses were sold to Parsons.  A number of ex GEC employees were recruited by Associated Electrical Industries (AEI).  A hostile takeover bid was made for AEI in 1967 and the relative profitability/share prices enabled GEC to take over the much larger AEI.  In 1968 English Electric agreed to merge with GEC.  Further takeovers and mergers made the company one of the largest private employers in the UK.  In 1989, Arnold Weinstock agreed a merger between the power and transport businesses of GEC and those of Alsthom of France, part of Compagnie Générale d’Electricité (CGE) to form GEC Alsthom.  While Weinstock was in charge the UK arm, the company continued to prosper, but after his death of his son in 1996 he was asked to retire and most of the company’s operations were transferred to France, or were sold off.  Small sales and service operations remain for some of the products.  Many of the factories have been demolished, with only Stafford continuing on a moderate scale.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Vulcan Foundry was originally opened in 1830 at Newton-le-Willows, as Charles Tayleur and Company.  It initially produced girders for bridges, switches and crossings, and other ironwork following the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.  Robert Stephenson became a partner in 1832, and in the same year, the first locomotives ‘Tayleur’ and ‘Stephenson’ were delivered to the North Union Railway.  By 1840 locomotives had been delivered to five European countries and to North America.  The company became The Vulcan Foundry Company in 1847 and acquired limited liability in 1864.  From the beginning of 1898, the name changed again to The Vulcan Foundry Limited, dropping the word 'company.'  Vulcan locomotives were exported all over the world, with the first locomotives for Russia and Japan supplied in 1837 and 1871 respectively and a long association with India began in 1852.  First World War production included shells, gun mountings and mine sweeping equipment.  The first non-steam locomotive, an electric, was produced for India in 1929. The first diesel locomotive design commenced in 1932/33 and an agreement was reached with A/S Frichs in Denmark.  The English Electric 6K engine was used from this time.  The “Waltzing Matilda” tank was developed in 1938 and produced in large numbers and over five hundred ‘Austerity’ steam locomotives were produced for the War Department.  Other wartime production included gun mountings and torpedo parts.  In 1944 Vulcan acquired the locomotive business, Robert Stephenson &amp; Hawthorns Ltd, based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.     In 1946 the company began working with the English Electric Company producing diesel and electric locomotives and became part of the English Electric Group in 1955.  All locomotive building from Preston was transferred to Vulcan Foundry and Robert Stephenson’s in Darlington.  Under the new ownership, the works produced many locomotives for both domestic and foreign railways, notably the Deltic.  The mid-sixties saw the ‘RK’/’V’ engine production at Preston moved to Vulcan and Ruston &amp; Hornsby Ltd merged with English Electric Diesels in 1966.  After the General Electric Company plc (GEC) takeover in 1968 the Ruston name was used for some time inside what became GEC Diesels Ltd in 1975.  Engine production and development continued for locomotive, industrial and marine applications until after the GEC-Alsthom merger in 1989.  The company took over Mirlees Engines, Stockport in 1997 and was renamed Alstom Engines Ltd.</td>\n",

In 1976 the gallery moved to Colliergate in York, then moved again to nearby Castlegate in York in 1992. In 2007 the gallery moved to City Park, Bradford.  The gallery is host to a temporary exhibitions programme with on average six exhibitions each year, often solo retrospective shows of mid-career photographers, and also some group shows. The gallery also contains a bookshop and publishes its own books and catalogues, often to accompany its exhibitions, either by itself or in association with others such as Dewi Lewis Publishing and Photoworks.

A wholly owned subsidiary company of GEC, the company had offices and works, located at Trafford Park in Manchester, at Strand Road in Preston, and at Attercliffe Common, Sheffield.   The headquarters of GEC Traction was Trafford Park, Manchester (previously the headquarters of English Electric-AEI Traction) with design of rotating machines at Preston and Sheffield, and manufacturing activities for control equipment at Manchester and Preston.  GEC Traction designed and manufactured a full range of traction machines and control equipment for electric vehicles, including electric locomotives and multiple unit trains for main-line and mass-transit railway systems (dc up to 3,000 volts, and ac up to 50,000 volts), diesel-electric locomotives and trains, mining and industrial locomotives, tramcars and trolleybuses.  GEC Traction was the leading supplier of traction equipment in the UK and had a wide market around the world, particularly in South Africa, Australasia, Hong Kong, South Korea, South America and Pakistan.  In 1979 the Industrial Locomotive Division of the former English Electric which was based at Vulcan Works, Newton-le-Willows was merged into GEC Traction, which later became a separate company, GEC Industrial Locomotives Ltd.  During the late 1980s and 1990s the firm underwent major rationalisation, involving closure of several sites including Attercliffe Common in Sheffield in 1985 and the company’s headquarters at Trafford Park in Manchester in 1998.  The company name GEC Traction endured until a merger with the French Alsthom group in 1989, which created GEC Alsthom Traction, which was still a branch of the main company GEC Alsthom.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In 1962, the English Electric Company Ltd amalgamated the locomotive-building activities of their already-owned Vulcan Foundry (Newton-le-Willows Works) and its subsidiary Robert Stephenson &amp; Hawthorns (Darlington Works), and W. G. Bagnall Ltd (Castle Engine Works, Stafford) under one management and a new wholly-owned subsidiary was formed named English Electric Traction.  W. G. Bagnall Ltd was bought from W H Dorman in 1962 and effectively closed.  The RSH works at Darlington ceased vehicle building in 1964.  Vulcan Foundry was left as the only site for in-house locomotive building at the end of this period of contraction and rationalisation.  It also took over manufacture (from Preston) of the range of EE diesel engines for railway locomotive use under the EE Diesels name.  English Electric Traction initially operated from two Works to produce electrical equipment for locomotives and multiple-unit trains.  These were in Preston (Strand Road, formerly Dick Kerr Works), and Bradford (Phoenix Dynamo Works).  The Bradford works had done design work and manufacture of control gear as part of EE since 1930, but this activity was rationalised after 1962 and incorporated into the Preston operation by 1967, when the transfer of design engineering and commercial activities and staff was completed.  The Preston works became the HQ centre for traction equipment (both control gear and motors), scheme design, building and testing.  This equipment was sent to independent vehicle builders, to vehicle-builders in-house (i.e. at Vulcan Foundry or RSH), to overseas constructors, or to the British Rail workshops.  The EE Stafford works was only engaged in traction activity is a minor way, principally as in-house supplier of main transformers and tap-changers, e.g. for 25kV locomotives, and some research and development activities on HV equipment.  It was never part of EE Traction itself.  The EE-AEI agreement, in the early sixties, resulted in joint electric loco production, for British Rail (Class 86), Poland, Pakistan and South Africa - 5E's were EE, 5E1's MV and after that joint production of electrical equipment with build of the mechanical parts in South Africa.  English Electric Traction merged with AEI Traction Division in 1969 to form English Electric - AEI Traction, which subsequently became GEC Traction in 1972.</td>\n",

       "      <td>“British Railways” is the expression commonly used to describe the business run by the following legal entities:  • Railway Executive (1948 – 1952) • British Transport Commission (1952 – 1963) • British Railways Board (1963 – 1993)  Railways were nationalised on 1st January 1948 when the assets of the railways in Great Britain were vested in the British Transport Commission (BTC), a state-owned corporation created by the Transport Act 1947.  Between 1948 and 1952 the business of operating the railways was carried on by the Railway Executive, a state-owned corporation, subsidiary to BTC.  The Railway Executive was abolished in 1952 and BTC took over direct responsibility for the railways.  Before 1948 there was no brand that was identified with the whole of the railways of Great Britain, only the separate brands of the Group companies, Southern, Great Western, London, Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern, and London Transport.  The railways were run under the corporate identity “British Railways” from 1948 by both the Railway Executive and BTC.  The public manifestations of this were the words themselves on vehicles and premises, quasi-heraldic devices on locomotives (the so-called “cycling lion” followed by the “ferret and dartboard”) and the lozenge shape adopted (and clearly inspired by London Transport’s very similar logo) for station names.  When the nationalised transport industry was reorganised in 1963, BTC was itself abolished and a new statutory corporation created to run the railways.  This was British Railways Board (BRB).  The name most closely associated with the national railway system had now become part of the name of the corporate entity, (i.e. the legal person, entitled as a matter of law to own property, to enter into contracts, and to sue (or be sued) in the courts and be prosecuted for breaches of the criminal law) which owned the assets and business of the railways of Great Britain.  As a result of the corporate rebranding carried out in 1965 the business name, or brand name (as it was now expressly recognised to be), was shortened to “British Rail”.  However, BRB retained the full “British Railways” in its title until its eventual abolition under the provisions of the Transport Act 2000.</td>\n",

ODNB: Derrick Baxby, ‘Jenner, Edward (1749–1823)’, , 2004 [, accessed 21 Jan 2008]; Edward Jenner (1749–1823):    Edward Jenner was an English country doctor who introduced the vaccine for smallpox. Previously a keen practitioner of smallpox inoculation, Jenner took the principle a stage further by inducing immunity against this killer disease via exposure to a harmless related disease, cowpox. His technique provided safer and more reliable protection than traditional inoculation. Working in an agricultural community, Jenner knew of the country folklore that milkmaids never caught smallpox. They were known for their relatively flawless complexions, which were unmarked by smallpox scarring. However, they inevitably caught cowpox through their close work with cows. Jenner speculated that a bout of cowpox produced immunity against smallpox and even encountered locals who claimed to have deliberately infected themselves to provoke such a response. As a forward-thinking doctor who liked to experiment, Jenner wanted to prove his theory. In 1796 he inserted pus taken from Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid with cowpox, into a cut made in the arm of a local boy, James Phipps. Several days later, Jenner exposed the boy to smallpox. He was found to be immune. Jenner called his new method ‘vaccination’ after the Latin word for cow (vacca). But Jenner had no explanation for why this method worked - no-one could see the virus with the microscopes of the time. He submitted a paper to the Royal Society the following year. It was met with some interest but further proof was requested. Jenner proceeded to vaccinate and monitor several more children, including his own son. The full results of his study were published in 1798, but his apparent discovery was met with much opposition, and even ridicule. In time the value of his vaccine was recognised, but as many poorer communities had limited access to medical treatment it was several decades before its full benefits were realised. In 1853, 30 years after Jenner’s death, smallpox vaccination was made compulsory in England and Wales.  Key dates: 1757 - attended the grammar school at Wotton under Edge.  1763 - began training with Daniel Ludlow, an apothecary in Chipping Sodbury.   1783 - published an improved method for preparing pure emetic tartar (potassium antimony tartrate) by recrystallization.   1784 - soon after both the Montgolfiers' pioneering flight and the first flight in Britain, Jenner was involved in the flight of an unmanned balloon.   1789 - with another doctor, John Hickes, he inoculated some individuals, including his son the infant Edward Jenner, with material from a disease variously described as swinepox, pigpox, and cowpox.   1796 - performed the first documented cowpox inoculation.   1809 - made an honorary member of the Geological Society.</td>\n",

A wholly owned subsidiary company of GEC, the company had offices and works, located at Trafford Park in Manchester, at Strand Road in Preston, and at Attercliffe Common, Sheffield.   The headquarters of GEC Traction was Trafford Park, Manchester (previously the headquarters of English Electric-AEI Traction) with design of rotating machines at Preston and Sheffield, and manufacturing activities for control equipment at Manchester and Preston.  GEC Traction designed and manufactured a full range of traction machines and control equipment for electric vehicles, including electric locomotives and multiple unit trains for main-line and mass-transit railway systems (dc up to 3,000 volts, and ac up to 50,000 volts), diesel-electric locomotives and trains, mining and industrial locomotives, tramcars and trolleybuses.  GEC Traction was the leading supplier of traction equipment in the UK and had a wide market around the world, particularly in South Africa, Australasia, Hong Kong, South Korea, South America and Pakistan.  In 1979 the Industrial Locomotive Division of the former English Electric which was based at Vulcan Works, Newton-le-Willows was merged into GEC Traction, which later became a separate company, GEC Industrial Locomotives Ltd.  During the late 1980s and 1990s the firm underwent major rationalisation, involving closure of several sites including Attercliffe Common in Sheffield in 1985 and the company’s headquarters at Trafford Park in Manchester in 1998.  The company name GEC Traction endured until a merger with the French Alsthom group in 1989, which created GEC Alsthom Traction, which was still a branch of the main company GEC Alsthom.</td>\n",

In 1896 GE established a subsidiary company called British Thomson-Houston (BTH) for the exploitation of its products in the United Kingdom. In the railway field GE produced electric propulsion equipment, electric locomotives and diesel-electric locomotives from the 1930s and also supplied electrical equipment for PCC streetcars.  In 1989 GE agreed to combine its European business interests in appliances, medical systems, electrical distribution, and power systems with the formerly unrelated British corporation General Electric Company.  GE’s business groups in the early 21st century were in the areas of commercial finance; consumer finance; infrastructure (including diesel locomotives, jet engines, water treatment systems, and energy delivery systems such as power grids); consumer and industrial technologies (including appliances and lighting products); health care (including diagnostic and imaging products); and media and entertainment through NBC Universal.  In 2009 it was announced that GE had agreed to sell a majority stake in NBC Universal to Comcast.  In June 2014 GE bought Alstom’s Power and Grid businesses.</td>\n",

Humphrey brought financial and organisational skills to the company whilst Alliott was the designer and constructor of the early aircraft the company built at Brownsfield Mill on Great Ancoats Street, Manchester.  The first aircraft built was the Roe I Triplane named the Bullseye and first flown in 1909. The first successfully mass-produced aircraft was the Avro E or Avro 500 first flown in 1912. During the First World War the company's most successful model was the Avro 504. The company continued to manufacture the 504 for almost 20 years, producing 8,340 at factories in Hamble, Failsworth, Miles Platting and Newton Heath.  In the early years the company conducted test flights at the Alexandra Park aerodrome in South Manchester. By the 1920s a decision was taken to move test flights to Woodford, Cheshire, which continues to serve this function for BAE Systems.  In 1920 A. V. Roe &amp; Co Ltd was acquired by Crossley Motors, which could make use of the factory for building car bodies. By 1928 financial losses at Crossley prompted the sale of A. V. Roe &amp; Co Ltd to the Armstrong Siddeley Development Co. Also, in 1928 Alliott Verdon Roe sold his shares in the business and established a new company, Saunders-Roe. In 1935 A.V. Roe &amp; Co Ltd became a subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley.   A. V. Roe &amp; Co Ltd became experts in building training aircraft. In the 1930s the firm successfully marketed its biplane, the Avro Tutor, to the RAF. With war on the horizon, A. V. Roe &amp; Co Ltd shifted its focus to combat aircraft, including the Lancaster Bomber, Avro Manchester and Lincoln.   In the post-war years A. V. Roe &amp; Co Ltd adapted the Lancaster to create the civilian Lancasterian plane and the maritime reconnaissance plane, the Shackleton. The company's airliner, the Tudor, was less successful, though it played an important part in the Berlin Airlift. The Avro York was more successful, finding use both in the RAF and civilian life, and the Avro 748 series of turboprop passenger and freight aircraft were sold worldwide.  A. V. Roe &amp; Co Ltd was finally absorbed into Hawker Aviation in July 1963, and the 'Avro' brand name ceased to be used until British Aerospace (BAE) decided to revive it for the Avro RJ (regional jet) in 1994.</td>\n",

       "13489  GEC Traction (GECT) was formed in 1972 as part of the GEC Power Engineering Group following earlier amalgamations of the traction divisions of the General Electric Company (GEC), the English Electric Company (EE) and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI).  A wholly owned subsidiary company of GEC, the company had offices and works, located at Trafford Park in Manchester, at Strand Road in Preston, and at Attercliffe Common, Sheffield.   The headquarters of GEC Traction was Trafford Park, Manchester (previously the headquarters of English Electric-AEI Traction) with design of rotating machines at Preston and Sheffield, and manufacturing activities for control equipment at Manchester and Preston.  GEC Traction designed and manufactured a full range of traction machines and control equipment for electric vehicles, including electric locomotives and multiple unit trains for main-line and mass-transit railway systems (dc up to 3,000 volts, and ac up to 50,000 volts), diesel-electric locomotives and trains, mining and industrial locomotives, tramcars and trolleybuses.  GEC Traction was the leading supplier of traction equipment in the UK and had a wide market around the world, particularly in South Africa, Australasia, Hong Kong, South Korea, South America and Pakistan.  In 1979 the Industrial Locomotive Division of the former English Electric which was based at Vulcan Works, Newton-le-Willows was merged into GEC Traction, which later became a separate company, GEC Industrial Locomotives Ltd.  During the late 1980s and 1990s the firm underwent major rationalisation, involving closure of several sites including Attercliffe Common in Sheffield in 1985 and the company’s headquarters at Trafford Park in Manchester in 1998.  The company name GEC Traction endured until a merger with the French Alsthom group in 1989, which created GEC Alsthom Traction, which was still a branch of the main company GEC Alsthom.   \n",

       "13549  GEC Traction (GECT) was formed in 1972 as part of the GEC Power Engineering Group following earlier amalgamations of the traction divisions of the General Electric Company (GEC), the English Electric Company (EE) and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI).  A wholly owned subsidiary company of GEC, the company had offices and works, located at Trafford Park in Manchester, at Strand Road in Preston, and at Attercliffe Common, Sheffield.   The headquarters of GEC Traction was Trafford Park, Manchester (previously the headquarters of English Electric-AEI Traction) with design of rotating machines at Preston and Sheffield, and manufacturing activities for control equipment at Manchester and Preston.  GEC Traction designed and manufactured a full range of traction machines and control equipment for electric vehicles, including electric locomotives and multiple unit trains for main-line and mass-transit railway systems (dc up to 3,000 volts, and ac up to 50,000 volts), diesel-electric locomotives and trains, mining and industrial locomotives, tramcars and trolleybuses.  GEC Traction was the leading supplier of traction equipment in the UK and had a wide market around the world, particularly in South Africa, Australasia, Hong Kong, South Korea, South America and Pakistan.  In 1979 the Industrial Locomotive Division of the former English Electric which was based at Vulcan Works, Newton-le-Willows was merged into GEC Traction, which later became a separate company, GEC Industrial Locomotives Ltd.  During the late 1980s and 1990s the firm underwent major rationalisation, involving closure of several sites including Attercliffe Common in Sheffield in 1985 and the company’s headquarters at Trafford Park in Manchester in 1998.  The company name GEC Traction endured until a merger with the French Alsthom group in 1989, which created GEC Alsthom Traction, which was still a branch of the main company GEC Alsthom.   \n",

He was born in 1878 in Manchester. Along with his brother, Sir Alliott Verdon-Roe, he founded the A. V. Roe & Co Ltd company in 1910 (also known as Avro), which capitalised on A.V. Roe’s aeronautical inventions and experiments and went on to be of paramount importance to the training of air force officers. In 1918, Humphrey Verdon-Roe married Dr. Marie C. Stopes and together, they opened the first birth control clinic in Britain in London in 1921, the Mothers’ Clinic.  Humphrey Verdon-Roe died in 1949.   \n",

The locomotive was originally built for the North Western Railway of India in 1911 at the Vulcan Foundry works and given the works no. 3064.

       "13525  GEC Traction (GECT) was formed in 1972 as part of the GEC Power Engineering Group following earlier amalgamations of the traction divisions of the General Electric Company (GEC), the English Electric Company (EE) and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI).  A wholly owned subsidiary company of GEC, the company had offices and works, located at Trafford Park in Manchester, at Strand Road in Preston, and at Attercliffe Common, Sheffield.   The headquarters of GEC Traction was Trafford Park, Manchester (previously the headquarters of English Electric-AEI Traction) with design of rotating machines at Preston and Sheffield, and manufacturing activities for control equipment at Manchester and Preston.  GEC Traction designed and manufactured a full range of traction machines and control equipment for electric vehicles, including electric locomotives and multiple unit trains for main-line and mass-transit railway systems (dc up to 3,000 volts, and ac up to 50,000 volts), diesel-electric locomotives and trains, mining and industrial locomotives, tramcars and trolleybuses.  GEC Traction was the leading supplier of traction equipment in the UK and had a wide market around the world, particularly in South Africa, Australasia, Hong Kong, South Korea, South America and Pakistan.  In 1979 the Industrial Locomotive Division of the former English Electric which was based at Vulcan Works, Newton-le-Willows was merged into GEC Traction, which later became a separate company, GEC Industrial Locomotives Ltd.  During the late 1980s and 1990s the firm underwent major rationalisation, involving closure of several sites including Attercliffe Common in Sheffield in 1985 and the company’s headquarters at Trafford Park in Manchester in 1998.  The company name GEC Traction endured until a merger with the French Alsthom group in 1989, which created GEC Alsthom Traction, which was still a branch of the main company GEC Alsthom.   \n",

The locomotive was originally built for the North Western Railway of India in 1911 at the Vulcan Foundry works and given the works no. 3064.  In most respects it is a typical example of a locomotive of about 1900.  This was one of the first superheated engines built by Vulcan, which first supplied locomotives with Phoenix smokebox superheaters to the North West India Railway in 1911.  Later locomotives were fitted with Robinson-type or Schmidt-type superheaters, which had piston valves instead of slide valves.   \n",

       "13551  GEC Traction (GECT) was formed in 1972 as part of the GEC Power Engineering Group following earlier amalgamations of the traction divisions of the General Electric Company (GEC), the English Electric Company (EE) and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI).  A wholly owned subsidiary company of GEC, the company had offices and works, located at Trafford Park in Manchester, at Strand Road in Preston, and at Attercliffe Common, Sheffield.   The headquarters of GEC Traction was Trafford Park, Manchester (previously the headquarters of English Electric-AEI Traction) with design of rotating machines at Preston and Sheffield, and manufacturing activities for control equipment at Manchester and Preston.  GEC Traction designed and manufactured a full range of traction machines and control equipment for electric vehicles, including electric locomotives and multiple unit trains for main-line and mass-transit railway systems (dc up to 3,000 volts, and ac up to 50,000 volts), diesel-electric locomotives and trains, mining and industrial locomotives, tramcars and trolleybuses.  GEC Traction was the leading supplier of traction equipment in the UK and had a wide market around the world, particularly in South Africa, Australasia, Hong Kong, South Korea, South America and Pakistan.  In 1979 the Industrial Locomotive Division of the former English Electric which was based at Vulcan Works, Newton-le-Willows was merged into GEC Traction, which later became a separate company, GEC Industrial Locomotives Ltd.  During the late 1980s and 1990s the firm underwent major rationalisation, involving closure of several sites including Attercliffe Common in Sheffield in 1985 and the company’s headquarters at Trafford Park in Manchester in 1998.  The company name GEC Traction endured until a merger with the French Alsthom group in 1989, which created GEC Alsthom Traction, which was still a branch of the main company GEC Alsthom.   \n",

       "13474  GEC Traction (GECT) was formed in 1972 as part of the GEC Power Engineering Group following earlier amalgamations of the traction divisions of the General Electric Company (GEC), the English Electric Company (EE) and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI).  A wholly owned subsidiary company of GEC, the company had offices and works, located at Trafford Park in Manchester, at Strand Road in Preston, and at Attercliffe Common, Sheffield.   The headquarters of GEC Traction was Trafford Park, Manchester (previously the headquarters of English Electric-AEI Traction) with design of rotating machines at Preston and Sheffield, and manufacturing activities for control equipment at Manchester and Preston.  GEC Traction designed and manufactured a full range of traction machines and control equipment for electric vehicles, including electric locomotives and multiple unit trains for main-line and mass-transit railway systems (dc up to 3,000 volts, and ac up to 50,000 volts), diesel-electric locomotives and trains, mining and industrial locomotives, tramcars and trolleybuses.  GEC Traction was the leading supplier of traction equipment in the UK and had a wide market around the world, particularly in South Africa, Australasia, Hong Kong, South Korea, South America and Pakistan.  In 1979 the Industrial Locomotive Division of the former English Electric which was based at Vulcan Works, Newton-le-Willows was merged into GEC Traction, which later became a separate company, GEC Industrial Locomotives Ltd.  During the late 1980s and 1990s the firm underwent major rationalisation, involving closure of several sites including Attercliffe Common in Sheffield in 1985 and the company’s headquarters at Trafford Park in Manchester in 1998.  The company name GEC Traction endured until a merger with the French Alsthom group in 1989, which created GEC Alsthom Traction, which was still a branch of the main company GEC Alsthom.   \n",

Paul Getty Trust: ID: 500098588; mentioned in John Ford, ‘Ackermann, Rudolph (1764–1834)’, , Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2006 [] Rudolph Ackermann (1764–1834):    Rudolph Ackermann was born on 20 April 1764 at Stollberg, near Leipzig, in Saxony. When he was fifteen, Ackermann was apprenticed to his elder brother Friedrich, a saddler. During his apprenticeship, he also learned to draw and engrave. In 1782 started training as a carriage designer, first in Dresden and then at Hueningen, in Switzerland. In 1784 he was employed for six months by Antoine Carassi in Paris. He worked for the carriage maker Simons in Brussels in 1785–6. He moved to England in 1787, where his model of a state coach for the carriage maker Goodall led to his first important commission in 1790, to design a state coach for the lord lieutenant of Ireland. Between 1791 and 1820 he published thirteen books of designs for carriages.   Ackermann formed close connections with other émigrés from Saxony, most significantly with the Facius brothers and with J. C. Stadler, who worked as engravers for the leading print publisher John Boydell. From 1795-1805, he ran a drawing school in Strand, and in 1796 he published the first of many drawing books. In 1797, he began publishing decorative hand-coloured prints.  During the first decade of the 19th century, Ackermann continued to design state and other carriages.  He became a United Kingdom citizen on 24 March 1809.  In 1808 and 1809, Ackermann issued two publications which secured his reputation as a publisher of the finest colour plate books: The Microcosm of London, and the monthly magazine Repository of Arts. Ackermann employed the architectural draughtsman Augustus Pugin, and the figure drawer Thomas Rowlandson to provide illustrations and architectural drawings for his engravings.

Paul Getty Trust: ID: 500098588; mentioned in John Ford, ‘Ackermann, Rudolph (1764–1834)’, , Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2006 [] Rudolph Ackermann (1764–1834):    Rudolph Ackermann was born on 20 April 1764 at Stollberg, near Leipzig, in Saxony. When he was fifteen, Ackermann was apprenticed to his elder brother Friedrich, a saddler. During his apprenticeship, he also learned to draw and engrave. In 1782 started training as a carriage designer, first in Dresden and then at Hueningen, in Switzerland. In 1784 he was employed for six months by Antoine Carassi in Paris. He worked for the carriage maker Simons in Brussels in 1785–6. He moved to England in 1787, where his model of a state coach for the carriage maker Goodall led to his first important commission in 1790, to design a state coach for the lord lieutenant of Ireland. Between 1791 and 1820 he published thirteen books of designs for carriages.   Ackermann formed close connections with other émigrés from Saxony, most significantly with the Facius brothers and with J. C. Stadler, who worked as engravers for the leading print publisher John Boydell. From 1795-1805, he ran a drawing school in Strand, and in 1796 he published the first of many drawing books. In 1797, he began publishing decorative hand-coloured prints.  During the first decade of the 19th century, Ackermann continued to design state and other carriages.  He became a United Kingdom citizen on 24 March 1809.  In 1808 and 1809, Ackermann issued two publications which secured his reputation as a publisher of the finest colour plate books: The Microcosm of London, and the monthly magazine Repository of Arts. Ackermann employed the architectural draughtsman Augustus Pugin, and the figure drawer Thomas Rowlandson to provide illustrations and architectural drawings for his engravings.  Ackermann formally handed over his business, Ackermann & Co, to his younger sons in October 1832. He suffered a stroke in November 1833 and died on 30 March 1834 at his home at Cold Harbour, Finchley.   1825: established in a print shop at 191 Regent Street, London   \n",

Between 1948 and 1952 the business of operating the railways was carried on by the Railway Executive, a state-owned corporation, subsidiary to BTC.  The Railway Executive was abolished in 1952 and BTC took over direct responsibility for the railways.  Before 1948 there was no brand that was identified with the whole of the railways of Great Britain, only the separate brands of the Group companies, Southern, Great Western, London, Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern, and London Transport.  The railways were run under the corporate identity “British Railways” from 1948 by both the Railway Executive and BTC.  The public manifestations of this were the words themselves on vehicles and premises, quasi-heraldic devices on locomotives (the so-called “cycling lion” followed by the “ferret and dartboard”) and the lozenge shape adopted (and clearly inspired by London Transport’s very similar logo) for station names.  When the nationalised transport industry was reorganised in 1963, BTC was itself abolished and a new statutory corporation created to run the railways.  This was British Railways Board (BRB).  The name most closely associated with the national railway system had now become part of the name of the corporate entity, (i.e. the legal person, entitled as a matter of law to own property, to enter into contracts, and to sue (or be sued) in the courts and be prosecuted for breaches of the criminal law) which owned the assets and business of the railways of Great Britain.  As a result of the corporate rebranding carried out in 1965 the business name, or brand name (as it was now expressly recognised to be), was shortened to “British Rail”.

These were transferred to a newly-created operating body, the British Transport Commission (BTC). The British Transport Commission began operations on 1st January 1948, under Chairman Sir (later Lord) Cyril Hurcomb. At this time, the British Transport Commission acquired the “Big Four” grouped railways, with virtually all minor railways as well, together with the London Passenger Transport Board. This automatically transferred the assets of the rail companies to BTC, including ships, ports, hotels, and investments in bus, coach, and haulage companies. Two bus companies, Tilling and Scottish Motor Traction, were soon added, as well as long-distance road hauliers. The Transport Act charged the British Transport Commission with the task of charged with “integrating” various forms of transport into single public service.   The British Transport Commission did not directly operate transport services. Operations were delegated to five separately appointed executives: Docks and Inland Waterways, Hotels, London Transport, Road Transport, and Railways. The Railways Executive operated under the name British Railways. In 1949, the Road Transport Executive was divided into two separate executives: Road Haulage and Road Passenger. The Commission exercised financial control over these Executives, and managed them through schemes of delegation.   The Commission attempted to fulfil its statutory duty to “integrate” public transport by introducing Area Schemes. These were designed to establish regional monopolies for road passenger transport, ports, and harbours. “Integration” was also to be promoted through Charges Schemes, in which the true costs of different modes of transport were to be reflected in the charges. This was designed to attract traffic to the most economic and efficient mode of transport.   The structure of Executives was dramatically altered by the Transport Act 1953, which abolished all Executives, with the exception of London Transport. Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of transport systems was delegated to the chief regional managers. The railways were reorganised into a system of area boards for each of its six regions. In September 1953, Sir Brian Robertson became Chairman. Disposal of the haulage fleet also began at this time, but a lack of buyers made this difficult.   Rising costs, industrial action and competition from road traffic meant that the British Transport Commission was in financial trouble by 1955. It sought relief from this by publishing The Modernisation and Re-equipment of British Railways, a plan which proposed an investment in the railways of £1,240m over fifteen years. The main features of this plan were the replacement of steam with electric and diesel traction, the electrification of principle routes, and the introduction of new coaching stock.   Despite the modernisation plan, the financial position of the British Transport Commission worsened. Two government reviews, in 1956 and 1959, concluded that the Commission was unwieldy and had an insufficiently commercial outlook.   Sir Brian Robertson retired in May 1961, and was replaced by Dr Richard Beeching.   The BTC was abolished by the Transport Act 1962. It was replaced with five new authorities that were answerable to the Minister of Transport: the British Railways Board, the British Transport Docks Board, the British Waterways Board, the London Transport Board, and the Transport Holding Company. Dr Beeching became chair of the British Railways Board.   Created during nationalisation but ran into financial difficulties in the late 1950's. It was abolished by the 1962 Transport Act when British Railways Board was created to replace it.   \n",

Roe left school at fifteen and in 1893 he became an apprentice at the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway locomotive works, afterwards studying marine engineering at King's College, London. In 1899 he joined the British and South African Royal Mail Company.   During his last voyage in 1902, he became fascinated with flight and began making flying models in his spare time. In 1907 Roe won £75 in a model aeroplane competition. He used the money to build a full-sized copy of his model. After fitting a more powerful engine in 1908, he managed a number of short flights at Brooklands; this was the first time a British designed and built aeroplane had flown.   In January 1910 his brother, Humphrey Verdon Roe helped to found A. V. Roe & Co. in Manchester. In 1911 he designed the first enclosed cabin aeroplane, which flew in 1912 and was entered in the British military trials that year. In October 1912 it established a British flying record of seven and a half hours.  In the following year Roe designed and built the famous Avro 504 which became the best-known military aeroplane of the First World War. An Avro 504 carried out a raid on the Zeppelin sheds at Friedrichshafen on 21 November 1914, which was the first air raid in the history of warfare. The plane was revolutionary in its design and in 1917 it became the standard trainer and for a quarter of a century.   Business declined after the war and Roe sold the controlling interest in A. V. Roe & Co. to the Armstrong Siddeley Motor Company in 1928. Roe and two other investors bought an interest in the boat builder Saunders Ltd, of Cowes.

British Railways came into existence, as the business name of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission (BTC), on 1 January 1948 when it took over the assets of the Big Four. The name continued to be used until British Railways was rebranded as British Rail, in 1969. Founded in United Kingdom.   \n",

The Vulcan Foundry was originally opened in 1832, as Charles Tayleur and Company. It initially produced girders for bridges, switches and crossings, and other ironwork following the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Because of the distance from the locomotive works in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, it seemed preferable to build and support them locally. In 1832, Robert Stephenson became a partner for a few years. The company had become The Vulcan Foundry Company in 1847 and acquired limited liability in 1864. From the beginning of 1898, the name changed again to the The Vulcan Foundry Limited, dropping the word 'company.'  In 1944 the Vulcan Foundry acquired Robert Stephenson and Hawthornes Limited and in 1945 received a large order for 2-8-0 locomotives for UNRRA in Europe. The factory gradually changed over to diesel and electric production and in 1955 became part of the English Electric group. Under the new ownership, the works has produced many locomotives for both domestic and foreign railways, notably the Deltic.   The factory passed through various hands firstly as GEC Alsthom then Alstom, and finally as part of MAN B&W Diesel in 2000. At the end of 2002 the works closed. It was then an industrial estate (appropriately called \"Vulcan Industrial Estate\"). The site was just North of Winwick Junction where the line to Newton Le Willows branches off to the west from the West Coast Main Line. All buildings on the site were demolished in October 2007. Founded in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens, Merseyside, England, United Kingdom.   \n",

The gallery was founded by Val Williams and husband Andrew Sproxton in November 1972, opening in York with two exhibitions, Butlin's by the Sea by Martin Parr and Daniel Meadows (its first exhibition), and Whitby by Frank Meadow Sutcliffe. In 1976 the gallery moved to Colliergate in York, then moved again to nearby Castlegate in York in 1992. In 2007 the gallery moved to City Park, Bradford.  The gallery is host to a temporary exhibitions programme with on average six exhibitions each year, often solo retrospective shows of mid-career photographers, and also some group shows.

In the 1960's Dr Richard Beeching became chairman of the board and started a programme of radical reorganisation. In 1969 British Railways was rebranded and the name British Rail, complete with its double arrow logo, was introduced.

In the 1960's Dr Richard Beeching became chairman of the board and started a programme of radical reorganisation. In 1969 British Railways was rebranded and the name British Rail, complete with its double arrow logo, was introduced. In 1993 the company was split into 100 separate parts and privatised under John Major's 1993 Railways Act.  The Transport Act of 2000 finally ended the British Railway Board and its remaining responsibilities were dispersed, though it still remains responsible for the Transport police.   \n",

The LNER was the second biggest of the the 'Big Four' railway companies formed during grouping.  The group consisted of seven constituent and 26 subsidiary companies. The constituents were North Eastern, Great Northern, Great Eastern, Great Central, Hull & Barnsley, North British and Great North of Scotland.

In the 1960's Dr Richard Beeching became chairman of the board and started a programme of radical reorganisation. In 1969 British Railways was rebranded and the name British Rail, complete with its double arrow logo, was introduced. In 1993 the company was split into 100 separate parts and privatised under John Major's 1993 Railways Act.  The Transport Act of 2000 finally ended the British Railway Board and its remaining responsibilities were dispersed, though it still remains responsible for the Transport police.   \n",

Dunlop Tyres was an international United Kingdom-based company  The current company dates to 1990 when Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company bought the European tyre business. The company once had many other manufacturing interests (particularly manufacturing involving rubber) but many of these have been sold off but still trade using the Dunlop name. For instance a branch of the company which made protective boots which was sold to a company in the Netherlands who still utilise the name Dunlop.      ;   \n",

The LNER was the second biggest of the the 'Big Four' railway companies formed during grouping.  The group consisted of seven constituent and 26 subsidiary companies. The constituents were North Eastern, Great Northern, Great Eastern, Great Central, Hull & Barnsley, North British and Great North of Scotland.

In 1800 he built the first of the double-acting stationary engine which was the forerunner of the famous ‘Cornish engines’. Between 1801 and 1803 he built three steam-powered road locomotives. In 1803 he built the first practical railway locomotive, a tram engine for Coalbrookdale. After that he constructed the ‘Pen-y-darren’ locomotive for Samuel Homfray, partner in the ‘Pen-y-darren Tramway’ in south Wales. Although this was not a success due to the quality of the track rather than the locomotive, it was a proof of principle. Trevithick built two more railway locomotives: one in Gateshead in 1805, possibly for the Wylam Waggon Way (which was again let down by the poor quality of the rails), and, in 1808, the ‘Catch me who Can’, for an exhibition in London. He is also important for demonstrating that a smooth wheel running on smooth iron rails was capable of hauling considerable loads.  He was involved in the unsuccessful project to drive a tunnel under the Thames from Rotherhithe. In 1816 he left his family and went to South America where he was involved in mining ventures in Peru. These also were ultimately unsuccessful, in part due to the wars of independence, and Trevithick returned, penniless, to England in 1827. Despite the setbacks he experienced, Trevithick’s inventive capacity was undiminished. His last patent was granted in 1832. He went to work for J. Hall in Dartford where he died on 22nd April 1833.  He was married to Jane Harvey (1772 – 1868/9), daughter of another Cornish engineer, John Harvey of Hayle Foundry and had six children, Francis and Frederick Henry, who both became engineers, and Richard, John, Ann and Elizabeth.

The LNER was the second biggest of the the 'Big Four' railway companies formed during grouping.  The group consisted of seven constituent and 26 subsidiary companies. The constituents were North Eastern, Great Northern, Great Eastern, Great Central, Hull & Barnsley, North British and Great North of Scotland.

It employed highly skilled craftsmen such as Thomas Griffits and did much to advance the use of colour lithography. It printed many of London Transport’s pictorial posters, often using it’s own artists such as Shep.  The Baynard Press was amongst the largest and most technically accomplished printing firms in Britain. They had machinery and plant resources that allowed them to produce large-scale poster images for the advertising of London Transport and various other organisations.   The Baynard Press also maintained a level of technical excellence through the employment of Thomas Griffits and other master craftsmen. This allowed the firm to produce work of the highest standard. At the outbreak of WW2, the entire resources of the firm were made available to support the war effort. Founded in Stockwell, London, Greater London, England, United Kingdom.

The gallery was founded by Val Williams and husband Andrew Sproxton in November 1972, opening in York with two exhibitions, Butlin's by the Sea by Martin Parr and Daniel Meadows (its first exhibition), and Whitby by Frank Meadow Sutcliffe. In 1976 the gallery moved to Colliergate in York, then moved again to nearby Castlegate in York in 1992. In 2007 the gallery moved to City Park, Bradford.  The gallery is host to a temporary exhibitions programme with on average six exhibitions each year, often solo retrospective shows of mid-career photographers, and also some group shows.

The gallery was founded by Val Williams and husband Andrew Sproxton in November 1972, opening in York with two exhibitions, Butlin's by the Sea by Martin Parr and Daniel Meadows (its first exhibition), and Whitby by Frank Meadow Sutcliffe. In 1976 the gallery moved to Colliergate in York, then moved again to nearby Castlegate in York in 1992. In 2007 the gallery moved to City Park, Bradford.  The gallery is host to a temporary exhibitions programme with on average six exhibitions each year, often solo retrospective shows of mid-career photographers, and also some group shows.

British Railways came into existence, as the business name of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission (BTC), on 1 January 1948 when it took over the assets of the Big Four. The name continued to be used until British Railways was rebranded as British Rail, in 1969. Founded in United Kingdom.   \n",

Bryden, ‘Evidence from advertising for mathematical instrument making in London, 1556–1714’, Annals of Science, 49 (1992), 301–36   Born in or around the year 1618, few details on the life of instrument maker Walter Hayes are known for certain, although he is referenced in an entry of the Diary of Samuel Pepys. On 16 September 1664, Pepys described him as the ‘mathematical instrument maker at Moorefields’. His shop there was known as the 'Cross Daggers, next door to the Pope's Head Tavern near Benthlem Gate in Moorfield'  but he also had another workshop situated in Cornhill, also in London. Hayes used the depiction of crossed daggers as his shop sign and in the printed advertisements he made from the 1650s.  Primarily a maker of mathematical instruments made from silver, brass and wood, Hayes was a skilled engraver and took many apprentices during his three decades of instrument making including Edmund Culpeper. There is evidence that Hayes also operated as a book-seller on behalf of others, and some of the books that he sold may have accompanied, or were linked to, the mathematical implements that he sold.  A member of the Grocer's Guild, Hayes' instruments included quadrants, astrolabes, protractors and other measuring tools.

Bryden, ‘Evidence from advertising for mathematical instrument making in London, 1556–1714’, Annals of Science, 49 (1992), 301–36   Born in or around the year 1618, few details on the life of instrument maker Walter Hayes are known for certain, although he is referenced in an entry of the Diary of Samuel Pepys. On 16 September 1664, Pepys described him as the ‘mathematical instrument maker at Moorefields’. His shop there was known as the 'Cross Daggers, next door to the Pope's Head Tavern near Benthlem Gate in Moorfield'  but he also had another workshop situated in Cornhill, also in London. Hayes used the depiction of crossed daggers as his shop sign and in the printed advertisements he made from the 1650s.  Primarily a maker of mathematical instruments made from silver, brass and wood, Hayes was a skilled engraver and took many apprentices during his three decades of instrument making including Edmund Culpeper. There is evidence that Hayes also operated as a book-seller on behalf of others, and some of the books that he sold may have accompanied, or were linked to, the mathematical implements that he sold.  A member of the Grocer's Guild, Hayes' instruments included quadrants, astrolabes, protractors and other measuring tools. In addition to engraving his name on objects, in some cases he engraved a stylised monogram to indicate he was the maker and this may have been a form of early modern branding. He is thought to have died in either 1695 or 1696.   \n",

Included in this company were the interests of the Metropolitan-Vickers General Railway Signal Co., (later to become GEC General Railway Signal).  The newly formed company established its headquarters, at Trafford Park, Manchester, and operated from three other sites, Attercliffe Common in Sheffield, Rugby Works, and Stockton Works supplying traction motors, machines, control gear and mechanical parts of locomotives.

The firm was established in Sheffield in 1845 by George Walker. Between 1848 and 1853 the company was known as Walker, Coulson & Hall until they became simply Walker & Hall in 1853. In 1920 they became a limited company. They had premises at Howard Street, Sheffield and showrooms throughout the country. In 1963 they joined with Mappin & Webb and Elkington & Co to form British Silverware Limited.   \n",
       "13475  The General Electric Company (GEC) was created as the General Electric Apparatus Company in 1886 by Hugo Hirst and Gustav Byng from a small electrical business established in London by Byng (Gustav Binswanger and Company, using Byng's original name).  In 1887 GEC published the first electrical catalogue of its kind.  The following year the company acquired its first factory in Manchester where telephones, electric bells, ceiling roses and switches were manufactured.  In 1889, the General Electric Co. Ltd. was formed as a private limited company and moved to larger premises at 71, Queen Victoria Street.  Now known also as G.E.C., the company was expanding rapidly, opening new branches and factories.  Initially manufacture was focussed on electric bells and light fittings, but this expanded to a wide range of electrical equipment - resulting in the firm's slogan 'Everything Electrical'.  In 1893, GEC decided to invest in lamp manufacture. The resulting company, (to become Osram in 1909), was to lead the way in lamp design and the burgeoning demand for electric lighting was to make GEC's fortune.  In 1900, GEC was incorporated as a public limited company, The General Electric Company (1900) Ltd, (the '1900' was dropped three years later).    In 1902, GEC's first purpose-built factory, the Witton Engineering Works was opened near Birmingham which designed and manufactured electrical equipment and machines.  Rapidly growing private and commercial use of electricity ensured buoyant demand and the company expanded both at home and overseas, with the establishment of agencies in Europe, Japan, Australia, South Africa and India and a substantial export trade to South America.  The outbreak of the First World War transformed GEC into a major player in the electrical industry with profits to match.  The company was heavily involved in the war effort, with products such as radios, signalling lamps and arc-lamp carbons.  Between the wars, GEC expanded to become an international corporation and a national institution. The take-over of Fraser and Chalmers in 1918 took GEC into heavy engineering and consolidated their claim to supply 'Everything Electrical'.  Other major factories included Osram Lamps at Hammersmith and the telephone works in Coventry.  During the 1920s, the company was heavily involved in the creation of the UK national grid.  In addition, the opening of the new purpose built company headquarters in Kingsway, London in 1921, and the pioneering industrial research laboratories at Wembley in 1923, were symbolic of the continuing expansion of both GEC and the electrical industry.  The company took over several companies in the Birmingham area and elsewhere.  After being a minor player in tram equipment, the company entered the heavy rail electric traction market in the 1920’s and 30’s.  During the Second World War, GEC was a major supplier to the military of electrical and engineering products.  Significant contributions to the war effort included the development of the cavity magnetron for radar, advances in communications technology and the on-going mass production of lamps and lighting equipment.  After the war the company continued in the full range of electrical equipment from electronics to atomic power stations, but was not very profitable.  In 1961, after a failed takeover bid from the English Electric Company, GEC took over Radio and Allied Industries, a small but very profitable television set manufacturer.  Michael Sobell and Arnold Weinstock from this company became GEC directors with a substantial shareholding.  Weinstock became managing director in 1963 and undertook drastic changes to make the company more profitable.  The rail traction operations were closed and the heavy electrical/ power station businesses were sold to Parsons.  A number of ex GEC employees were recruited by Associated Electrical Industries (AEI).  A hostile takeover bid was made for AEI in 1967 and the relative profitability/share prices enabled GEC to take over the much larger AEI.  In 1968 English Electric agreed to merge with GEC.  Further takeovers and mergers made the company one of the largest private employers in the UK.  In 1989, Arnold Weinstock agreed a merger between the power and transport businesses of GEC and those of Alsthom of France, part of Compagnie Générale d’Electricité (CGE) to form GEC Alsthom.  While Weinstock was in charge the UK arm, the company continued to prosper, but after his death of his son in 1996 he was asked to retire and most of the company’s operations were transferred to France, or were sold off.  Small sales and service operations remain for some of the products.  Many of the factories have been demolished, with only Stafford continuing on a moderate scale.   \n",

It initially produced girders for bridges, switches and crossings, and other ironwork following the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.  Robert Stephenson became a partner in 1832, and in the same year, the first locomotives ‘Tayleur’ and ‘Stephenson’ were delivered to the North Union Railway.  By 1840 locomotives had been delivered to five European countries and to North America.  The company became The Vulcan Foundry Company in 1847 and acquired limited liability in 1864.  From the beginning of 1898, the name changed again to The Vulcan Foundry Limited, dropping the word 'company.'  Vulcan locomotives were exported all over the world, with the first locomotives for Russia and Japan supplied in 1837 and 1871 respectively and a long association with India began in 1852.  First World War production included shells, gun mountings and mine sweeping equipment.  The first non-steam locomotive, an electric, was produced for India in 1929. The first diesel locomotive design commenced in 1932/33 and an agreement was reached with A/S Frichs in Denmark.  The English Electric 6K engine was used from this time.  The “Waltzing Matilda” tank was developed in 1938 and produced in large numbers and over five hundred ‘Austerity’ steam locomotives were produced for the War Department.  Other wartime production included gun mountings and torpedo parts.  In 1944 Vulcan acquired the locomotive business, Robert Stephenson & Hawthorns Ltd, based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.     In 1946 the company began working with the English Electric Company producing diesel and electric locomotives and became part of the English Electric Group in 1955.  All locomotive building from Preston was transferred to Vulcan Foundry and Robert Stephenson’s in Darlington.  Under the new ownership, the works produced many locomotives for both domestic and foreign railways, notably the Deltic.  The mid-sixties saw the ‘RK’/’V’ engine production at Preston moved to Vulcan and Ruston & Hornsby Ltd merged with English Electric Diesels in 1966.  After the General Electric Company plc (GEC) takeover in 1968 the Ruston name was used for some time inside what became GEC Diesels Ltd in 1975.  Engine production and development continued for locomotive, industrial and marine applications until after the GEC-Alsthom merger in 1989.  The company took over Mirlees Engines, Stockport in 1997 and was renamed Alstom Engines Ltd.   \n",

The gallery was founded by Val Williams and husband Andrew Sproxton in November 1972, opening in York with two exhibitions, Butlin's by the Sea by Martin Parr and Daniel Meadows (its first exhibition), and Whitby by Frank Meadow Sutcliffe. In 1976 the gallery moved to Colliergate in York, then moved again to nearby Castlegate in York in 1992. In 2007 the gallery moved to City Park, Bradford.  The gallery is host to a temporary exhibitions programme with on average six exhibitions each year, often solo retrospective shows of mid-career photographers, and also some group shows.

Founded in United Kingdom. Dissolved 1922-12-31.         In 1846 three companies, London & Birmingham, Grand Junction Railway and Manchester & Birmingham amalgamated to form the London & North Western Railway. The London & North Western Railway continued to expand and by 1868 the company had added links to Oxford, Cambridge, Leeds, Swansea and Cardiff.

The LNER was the second biggest of the the 'Big Four' railway companies formed during grouping.  The group consisted of seven constituent and 26 subsidiary companies. The constituents were North Eastern, Great Northern, Great Eastern, Great Central, Hull & Barnsley, North British and Great North of Scotland. As the name suggests the company covered the arc of the country between north and east of London and included the East Coast Mainline. The main workshops for the company were in Doncaster. // Birth Place: Leeds, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, United Kingdom.

G. Bagnall Ltd (Castle Engine Works, Stafford) under one management and a new wholly-owned subsidiary was formed named English Electric Traction.  W. G. Bagnall Ltd was bought from W H Dorman in 1962 and effectively closed.  The RSH works at Darlington ceased vehicle building in 1964.  Vulcan Foundry was left as the only site for in-house locomotive building at the end of this period of contraction and rationalisation.  It also took over manufacture (from Preston) of the range of EE diesel engines for railway locomotive use under the EE Diesels name.  English Electric Traction initially operated from two Works to produce electrical equipment for locomotives and multiple-unit trains.  These were in Preston (Strand Road, formerly Dick Kerr Works), and Bradford (Phoenix Dynamo Works).  The Bradford works had done design work and manufacture of control gear as part of EE since 1930, but this activity was rationalised after 1962 and incorporated into the Preston operation by 1967, when the transfer of design engineering and commercial activities and staff was completed.  The Preston works became the HQ centre for traction equipment (both control gear and motors), scheme design, building and testing.  This equipment was sent to independent vehicle builders, to vehicle-builders in-house (i.e. at Vulcan Foundry or RSH), to overseas constructors, or to the British Rail workshops.  The EE Stafford works was only engaged in traction activity is a minor way, principally as in-house supplier of main transformers and tap-changers, e.g. for 25kV locomotives, and some research and development activities on HV equipment.  It was never part of EE Traction itself.  The EE-AEI agreement, in the early sixties, resulted in joint electric loco production, for British Rail (Class 86), Poland, Pakistan and South Africa - 5E's were EE, 5E1's MV and after that joint production of electrical equipment with build of the mechanical parts in South Africa.  English Electric Traction merged with AEI Traction Division in 1969 to form English Electric - AEI Traction, which subsequently became GEC Traction in 1972.   \n",

Between 1948 and 1952 the business of operating the railways was carried on by the Railway Executive, a state-owned corporation, subsidiary to BTC.  The Railway Executive was abolished in 1952 and BTC took over direct responsibility for the railways.  Before 1948 there was no brand that was identified with the whole of the railways of Great Britain, only the separate brands of the Group companies, Southern, Great Western, London, Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern, and London Transport.  The railways were run under the corporate identity “British Railways” from 1948 by both the Railway Executive and BTC.  The public manifestations of this were the words themselves on vehicles and premises, quasi-heraldic devices on locomotives (the so-called “cycling lion” followed by the “ferret and dartboard”) and the lozenge shape adopted (and clearly inspired by London Transport’s very similar logo) for station names.  When the nationalised transport industry was reorganised in 1963, BTC was itself abolished and a new statutory corporation created to run the railways.  This was British Railways Board (BRB).  The name most closely associated with the national railway system had now become part of the name of the corporate entity, (i.e. the legal person, entitled as a matter of law to own property, to enter into contracts, and to sue (or be sued) in the courts and be prosecuted for breaches of the criminal law) which owned the assets and business of the railways of Great Britain.  As a result of the corporate rebranding carried out in 1965 the business name, or brand name (as it was now expressly recognised to be), was shortened to “British Rail”.

ODNB: Derrick Baxby, ‘Jenner, Edward (1749–1823)’, , 2004 [, accessed 21 Jan 2008]; Edward Jenner (1749–1823):    Edward Jenner was an English country doctor who introduced the vaccine for smallpox. Previously a keen practitioner of smallpox inoculation, Jenner took the principle a stage further by inducing immunity against this killer disease via exposure to a harmless related disease, cowpox. His technique provided safer and more reliable protection than traditional inoculation. Working in an agricultural community, Jenner knew of the country folklore that milkmaids never caught smallpox. They were known for their relatively flawless complexions, which were unmarked by smallpox scarring. However, they inevitably caught cowpox through their close work with cows. Jenner speculated that a bout of cowpox produced immunity against smallpox and even encountered locals who claimed to have deliberately infected themselves to provoke such a response. As a forward-thinking doctor who liked to experiment, Jenner wanted to prove his theory. In 1796 he inserted pus taken from Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid with cowpox, into a cut made in the arm of a local boy, James Phipps. Several days later, Jenner exposed the boy to smallpox. He was found to be immune. Jenner called his new method ‘vaccination’ after the Latin word for cow (vacca). But Jenner had no explanation for why this method worked - no-one could see the virus with the microscopes of the time. He submitted a paper to the Royal Society the following year. It was met with some interest but further proof was requested. Jenner proceeded to vaccinate and monitor several more children, including his own son. The full results of his study were published in 1798, but his apparent discovery was met with much opposition, and even ridicule. In time the value of his vaccine was recognised, but as many poorer communities had limited access to medical treatment it was several decades before its full benefits were realised.

In 1896 GE established a subsidiary company called British Thomson-Houston (BTH) for the exploitation of its products in the United Kingdom. In the railway field GE produced electric propulsion equipment, electric locomotives and diesel-electric locomotives from the 1930s and also supplied electrical equipment for PCC streetcars.  In 1989 GE agreed to combine its European business interests in appliances, medical systems, electrical distribution, and power systems with the formerly unrelated British corporation General Electric Company.  GE’s business groups in the early 21st century were in the areas of commercial finance; consumer finance; infrastructure (including diesel locomotives, jet engines, water treatment systems, and energy delivery systems such as power grids); consumer and industrial technologies (including appliances and lighting products); health care (including diagnostic and imaging products); and media and entertainment through NBC Universal.  In 2009 it was announced that GE had agreed to sell a majority stake in NBC Universal to Comcast.  In June 2014 GE bought Alstom’s Power and Grid businesses.   \n",

The Furness Railway was a railway company operating in the Furness area of north-west England. The railway, which opened in 1844, originally ran from Kirkby-in-Furness to Dalton-in-Furness.

The Furness Railway was a railway company operating in the Furness area of north-west England. The railway, which opened in 1844, originally ran from Kirkby-in-Furness to Dalton-in-Furness. Subsequent extensions took the railway to Ulverston (April 1854), and when the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway was taken over, in 1865, it extended the railway to Whitehaven, Carnforth, Coniston and Lakeside. The Furness Railway operated as an independent company until December 1922, when it was merged as one of the constituent companies of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway following the Railways Act 1921.   \n",

V. Roe & Co Ltd one of the world's first aircraft manufacturers, in 1910. Humphrey brought financial and organisational skills to the company whilst Alliott was the designer and constructor of the early aircraft the company built at Brownsfield Mill on Great Ancoats Street, Manchester.  The first aircraft built was the Roe I Triplane named the Bullseye and first flown in 1909. The first successfully mass-produced aircraft was the Avro E or Avro 500 first flown in 1912. During the First World War the company's most successful model was the Avro 504. The company continued to manufacture the 504 for almost 20 years, producing 8,340 at factories in Hamble, Failsworth, Miles Platting and Newton Heath.  In the early years the company conducted test flights at the Alexandra Park aerodrome in South Manchester. By the 1920s a decision was taken to move test flights to Woodford, Cheshire, which continues to serve this function for BAE Systems.  In 1920 A. V. Roe & Co Ltd was acquired by Crossley Motors, which could make use of the factory for building car bodies. By 1928 financial losses at Crossley prompted the sale of A. V. Roe & Co Ltd to the Armstrong Siddeley Development Co. Also, in 1928 Alliott Verdon Roe sold his shares in the business and established a new company, Saunders-Roe. In 1935 A.V. Roe & Co Ltd became a subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley.   A. V. Roe & Co Ltd became experts in building training aircraft. In the 1930s the firm successfully marketed its biplane, the Avro Tutor, to the RAF. With war on the horizon, A. V. Roe & Co Ltd shifted its focus to combat aircraft, including the Lancaster Bomber, Avro Manchester and Lincoln.   In the post-war years A. V. Roe & Co Ltd adapted the Lancaster to create the civilian Lancasterian plane and the maritime reconnaissance plane, the Shackleton. The company's airliner, the Tudor, was less successful, though it played an important part in the Berlin Airlift. The Avro York was more successful, finding use both in the RAF and civilian life, and the Avro 748 series of turboprop passenger and freight aircraft were sold worldwide.  A. V. Roe & Co Ltd was finally absorbed into Hawker Aviation in July 1963, and the 'Avro' brand name ceased to be used until British Aerospace (BAE) decided to revive it for the Avro RJ (regional jet) in 1994.   \n",
