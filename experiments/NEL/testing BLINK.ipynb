       "   'text': \"Roy Chadwick was born in Farnworth, Lancashire, in 1893.  After leaving school, he served as an apprentice draughtsman at the engineering firm British Westinghouse in Trafford Park, near Manchester.  During this period he studied at the Manchester College of Technology and was an avid model maker.  He joined the Manchester Aero Club and, through its activities, visited the A. V. Roe & Co. factory at Brownsfield Mill in Ancoats.  In 1911 Chadwick began work for A. V. Roe & Co. as a draughtsman and became Alliott Roe’s personal assistant. He showed a great talent for design and his career progressed rapidly.  He designed the fuselage and undercarriage for the famous Avro 504 which became the standard training aircraft used by the Royal Air Force. In 1918, 500 of these planes were being made per month.   In 1919 A. V. Roe appointed Chadwick as the company’s Chief Designer.  He was involved in the design of every subsequent Avro aircraft until his death in 1947.  In the inter-war years, Avro focused on planes used for joyriding and cross-country flight.  Chadwick’s Avro Baby won several races in 1919 and 1920.  It was also used for Bert Hinkler’s non-stop flights from Croydon to Turin and Riga. Chadwick also designed the Avro 554 floatplane for the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition to the Antarctic in 1921.  By the late 1920s, flying clubs and private enthusiasts wanted to buy new purpose-built civilian aeroplanes instead of military surplus aircraft.  Chadwick designed the Avian which was used in Hinkler’s solo flight to Australia in 15½ days. This record stood for nearly three years until Kingford Smith beat the time in a faster Avian.   In 1933, Avro was invited to modify the Imperial Airways 652 design to make it suitable for coastal reconnaissance.  The 652A Anson became a training plane and over 11,000 were built in the UK and Canada.   In 1939 Avro, by then part of the Hawker Siddeley Group, opened a new works at Chadderton and Chadwick moved his design team there.  At Chadderton, production began on the twin-engined Anson and the Manchester bomber, the forerunner of the famous Lancaster.  Chadwick modified the Manchester design to include four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines instead of two.  A total of 7,366 Lancasters was produced.  Lancasters dropped 600,000 tons of bombs, but were also used to drop food to the Allies and for repatriating 74,000 ex-prisoners of war.  Roy Chadwick was awarded the CBE in 1943, soon after the famous 'Dam Busters' raid, which involved 19 Lancasters.    After the Second World War, Chadwick turned his attention to the development of the Lancaster for more peaceful purposes.  A number of Lancaster fuselages were modified to make them suitable for long-distance passenger service. These were called Lancastrians and began the England-New Zealand express service, reaching Australia in 3½ days.  Chadwick also developed his Lincoln aircraft into the Tudor for passenger service over the Atlantic.  It was the first passenger plane with a pressurised cabin built in the UK.  Chadwick was tragically killed when a test fight of the Tudor II crashed at Woodford Aerodrome in 1947. \\n British Aircraft designer, born in Farnworth in 1893. Chadwick worked as a draughtsman at British Westinghouse in Trafford Park whist attending school and at age 18, in 1911, he began work at A.V. Roe & Co.

       "   'text': \"Roy Chadwick was born in Farnworth, Lancashire, in 1893.  After leaving school, he served as an apprentice draughtsman at the engineering firm British Westinghouse in Trafford Park, near Manchester.  During this period he studied at the Manchester College of Technology and was an avid model maker.  He joined the Manchester Aero Club and, through its activities, visited the A. V. Roe & Co. factory at Brownsfield Mill in Ancoats.  In 1911 Chadwick began work for A. V. Roe & Co. as a draughtsman and became Alliott Roe’s personal assistant. He showed a great talent for design and his career progressed rapidly.  He designed the fuselage and undercarriage for the famous Avro 504 which became the standard training aircraft used by the Royal Air Force. In 1918, 500 of these planes were being made per month.   In 1919 A. V. Roe appointed Chadwick as the company’s Chief Designer.  He was involved in the design of every subsequent Avro aircraft until his death in 1947.  In the inter-war years, Avro focused on planes used for joyriding and cross-country flight.  Chadwick’s Avro Baby won several races in 1919 and 1920.  It was also used for Bert Hinkler’s non-stop flights from Croydon to Turin and Riga. Chadwick also designed the Avro 554 floatplane for the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition to the Antarctic in 1921.  By the late 1920s, flying clubs and private enthusiasts wanted to buy new purpose-built civilian aeroplanes instead of military surplus aircraft.  Chadwick designed the Avian which was used in Hinkler’s solo flight to Australia in 15½ days. This record stood for nearly three years until [[Kingford Smith]] beat the time in a faster Avian.   In 1933, Avro was invited to modify the Imperial Airways 652 design to make it suitable for coastal reconnaissance.  The 652A Anson became a training plane and over 11,000 were built in the UK and Canada.   In 1939 Avro, by then part of the Hawker Siddeley Group, opened a new works at Chadderton and Chadwick moved his design team there.  At Chadderton, production began on the twin-engined Anson and the Manchester bomber, the forerunner of the famous Lancaster.  Chadwick modified the Manchester design to include four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines instead of two.  A total of 7,366 Lancasters was produced.  Lancasters dropped 600,000 tons of bombs, but were also used to drop food to the Allies and for repatriating 74,000 ex-prisoners of war.  Roy Chadwick was awarded the CBE in 1943, soon after the famous 'Dam Busters' raid, which involved 19 Lancasters.    After the Second World War, Chadwick turned his attention to the development of the Lancaster for more peaceful purposes.  A number of Lancaster fuselages were modified to make them suitable for long-distance passenger service. These were called Lancastrians and began the England-New Zealand express service, reaching Australia in 3½ days.  Chadwick also developed his Lincoln aircraft into the Tudor for passenger service over the Atlantic.  It was the first passenger plane with a pressurised cabin built in the UK.

He designed the fuselage and undercarriage for the famous Avro 504 which became the standard training aircraft used by the Royal Air Force. In 1918, 500 of these planes were being made per month.   In 1919 A. V. Roe appointed Chadwick as the company’s Chief Designer.  He was involved in the design of every subsequent Avro aircraft until his death in 1947.  In the inter-war years, Avro focused on planes used for joyriding and cross-country flight.  Chadwick’s Avro Baby won several races in 1919 and 1920.  It was also used for Bert Hinkler’s non-stop flights from Croydon to Turin and Riga. Chadwick also designed the Avro 554 floatplane for the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition to the Antarctic in 1921.  By the late 1920s, flying clubs and private enthusiasts wanted to buy new purpose-built civilian aeroplanes instead of military surplus aircraft.  Chadwick designed the Avian which was used in Hinkler’s solo flight to Australia in 15½ days. This record stood for nearly three years until Kingford Smith beat the time in a faster Avian.   In 1933, Avro was invited to modify the Imperial Airways 652 design to make it suitable for coastal reconnaissance.  The 652A Anson became a training plane and over 11,000 were built in the UK and Canada.   In 1939 Avro, by then part of the Hawker Siddeley Group, opened a new works at Chadderton and Chadwick moved his design team there.  At Chadderton, production began on the twin-engined Anson and the Manchester bomber, the forerunner of the famous Lancaster.  Chadwick modified the Manchester design to include four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines instead of two.  A total of 7,366 Lancasters was produced.  Lancasters dropped 600,000 tons of bombs, but were also used to drop food to the Allies and for repatriating 74,000 ex-prisoners of war.  Roy Chadwick was awarded the CBE in 1943, soon after the famous 'Dam Busters' raid, which involved 19 Lancasters.    After the Second World War, Chadwick turned his attention to the development of the Lancaster for more peaceful purposes.  A number of Lancaster fuselages were modified to make them suitable for long-distance passenger service. These were called Lancastrians and began the England-New Zealand express service, reaching Australia in 3½ days.  Chadwick also developed his Lincoln aircraft into the Tudor for passenger service over the Atlantic.  It was the first passenger plane with a pressurised cabin built in the UK.  Chadwick was tragically killed when a test fight of the Tudor II crashed at Woodford Aerodrome in 1947. \\n British Aircraft designer, born in Farnworth in 1893. Chadwick worked as a draughtsman at British Westinghouse in Trafford Park whist attending school and at age 18, in 1911, he began work at A.V. Roe & Co. Ltd as [[Alliott Verdon-Roe's]] personal assistant. He was appointed Avro's Chief Designer in 1918.   Chadwick designed a number of planes for AVRO, including the Avro F in 1912, the WW1 light bomber and training plane, the Avro 504, the Avro Avian and the Lancaster bomber.    Chadwick died on 23 August 1947 in a crash during the takeoff of the prototype Avro Tudor 2 G-AGSU from Woodford Aerodrome. \\n Educated at Manchester College of Technology; in 1911 he became associated with Alliott Verdon-Roe, a pioneer of British aviation; formed A V Roe & Co.

After the Second World War, Chadwick turned his attention to the development of the Lancaster for more peaceful purposes.  A number of Lancaster fuselages were modified to make them suitable for long-distance passenger service. These were called Lancastrians and began the England-New Zealand express service, reaching Australia in 3½ days.  Chadwick also developed his Lincoln aircraft into the Tudor for passenger service over the Atlantic.  It was the first passenger plane with a pressurised cabin built in the UK.

       "   'text': \"Roy Chadwick was born in Farnworth, Lancashire, in 1893.  After leaving school, he served as an apprentice draughtsman at the engineering firm British Westinghouse in Trafford Park, near Manchester.  During this period he studied at the Manchester College of Technology and was an avid model maker.  He joined the Manchester Aero Club and, through its activities, visited the A. V. Roe & Co. factory at Brownsfield Mill in Ancoats.  In 1911 Chadwick began work for A. V. Roe & Co. as a draughtsman and became Alliott Roe’s personal assistant. He showed a great talent for design and his career progressed rapidly.  He designed the fuselage and undercarriage for the famous Avro 504 which became the standard training aircraft used by the Royal Air Force. In 1918, 500 of these planes were being made per month.   In 1919 A. V. Roe appointed Chadwick as the company’s Chief Designer.  He was involved in the design of every subsequent Avro aircraft until his death in 1947.  In the inter-war years, Avro focused on planes used for joyriding and cross-country flight.  Chadwick’s Avro Baby won several races in 1919 and 1920.  It was also used for Bert Hinkler’s non-stop flights from Croydon to Turin and Riga. Chadwick also designed the Avro 554 floatplane for the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition to the Antarctic in 1921.  By the late 1920s, flying clubs and private enthusiasts wanted to buy new purpose-built civilian aeroplanes instead of military surplus aircraft.  Chadwick designed the Avian which was used in Hinkler’s solo flight to Australia in 15½ days. This record stood for nearly three years until Kingford Smith beat the time in a faster Avian.   In 1933, Avro was invited to modify the Imperial Airways 652 design to make it suitable for coastal reconnaissance.  The 652A Anson became a training plane and over 11,000 were built in the UK and Canada.   In 1939 Avro, by then part of the Hawker Siddeley Group, opened a new works at Chadderton and Chadwick moved his design team there.  At Chadderton, production began on the twin-engined Anson and the Manchester bomber, the forerunner of the famous Lancaster.  Chadwick modified the Manchester design to include four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines instead of two.  A total of 7,366 Lancasters was produced.

       "   'text': \"Roy Chadwick was born in Farnworth, Lancashire, in 1893.  After leaving school, he served as an apprentice draughtsman at the engineering firm British Westinghouse in Trafford Park, near Manchester.  During this period he studied at the Manchester College of Technology and was an avid model maker.  He joined the Manchester Aero Club and, through its activities, visited the A. V. Roe & Co. factory at Brownsfield Mill in Ancoats.  In 1911 Chadwick began work for A. V. Roe & Co. as a draughtsman and became Alliott Roe’s personal assistant. He showed a great talent for design and his career progressed rapidly.  He designed the fuselage and undercarriage for the famous Avro 504 which became the standard training aircraft used by the Royal Air Force. In 1918, 500 of these planes were being made per month.   In 1919 A. V. Roe appointed Chadwick as the company’s Chief Designer.  He was involved in the design of every subsequent Avro aircraft until his death in 1947.  In the inter-war years, Avro focused on planes used for joyriding and cross-country flight.  Chadwick’s Avro Baby won several races in 1919 and 1920.  It was also used for Bert Hinkler’s non-stop flights from Croydon to Turin and Riga. Chadwick also designed the Avro 554 floatplane for the [[Shackleton-Rowett Expedition]] to the Antarctic in 1921.  By the late 1920s, flying clubs and private enthusiasts wanted to buy new purpose-built civilian aeroplanes instead of military surplus aircraft.  Chadwick designed the Avian which was used in Hinkler’s solo flight to Australia in 15½ days. This record stood for nearly three years until Kingford Smith beat the time in a faster Avian.   In 1933, Avro was invited to modify the Imperial Airways 652 design to make it suitable for coastal reconnaissance.  The 652A Anson became a training plane and over 11,000 were built in the UK and Canada.   In 1939 Avro, by then part of the Hawker Siddeley Group, opened a new works at Chadderton and Chadwick moved his design team there.  At Chadderton, production began on the twin-engined Anson and the Manchester bomber, the forerunner of the famous Lancaster.  Chadwick modified the Manchester design to include four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines instead of two.  A total of 7,366 Lancasters was produced.  Lancasters dropped 600,000 tons of bombs, but were also used to drop food to the Allies and for repatriating 74,000 ex-prisoners of war.  Roy Chadwick was awarded the CBE in 1943, soon after the famous 'Dam Busters' raid, which involved 19 Lancasters.    After the Second World War, Chadwick turned his attention to the development of the Lancaster for more peaceful purposes.  A number of Lancaster fuselages were modified to make them suitable for long-distance passenger service. These were called Lancastrians and began the England-New Zealand express service, reaching Australia in 3½ days.  Chadwick also developed his Lincoln aircraft into the Tudor for passenger service over the Atlantic.  It was the first passenger plane with a pressurised cabin built in the UK.  Chadwick was tragically killed when a test fight of the Tudor II crashed at Woodford Aerodrome in 1947. \\n British Aircraft designer, born in Farnworth in 1893.

       "   'text': \"Roy Chadwick was born in Farnworth, Lancashire, in 1893.  After leaving school, he served as an apprentice draughtsman at the engineering firm British Westinghouse in Trafford Park, near Manchester.  During this period he studied at the Manchester College of Technology and was an avid model maker.  He joined the Manchester Aero Club and, through its activities, visited the A. V. Roe & Co. factory at Brownsfield Mill in Ancoats.  In 1911 Chadwick began work for A. V. Roe & Co. as a draughtsman and became Alliott Roe’s personal assistant. He showed a great talent for design and his career progressed rapidly.  He designed the fuselage and undercarriage for the famous Avro 504 which became the standard training aircraft used by the Royal Air Force. In 1918, 500 of these planes were being made per month.   In 1919 A. V. Roe appointed Chadwick as the company’s Chief Designer.  He was involved in the design of every subsequent Avro aircraft until his death in 1947.  In the inter-war years, Avro focused on planes used for joyriding and cross-country flight.  Chadwick’s Avro Baby won several races in 1919 and 1920.  It was also used for Bert Hinkler’s non-stop flights from Croydon to Turin and Riga. Chadwick also designed the Avro 554 floatplane for the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition to the Antarctic in 1921.  By the late 1920s, flying clubs and private enthusiasts wanted to buy new purpose-built civilian aeroplanes instead of military surplus aircraft.  Chadwick designed the Avian which was used in Hinkler’s solo flight to Australia in 15½ days. This record stood for nearly three years until Kingford Smith beat the time in a faster Avian.   In 1933, Avro was invited to modify the Imperial Airways 652 design to make it suitable for coastal reconnaissance.  The 652A Anson became a training plane and over 11,000 were built in the UK and Canada.   In 1939 Avro, by then part of the Hawker Siddeley Group, opened a new works at Chadderton and Chadwick moved his design team there.  At Chadderton, production began on the twin-engined Anson and the Manchester bomber, the forerunner of the famous Lancaster.  Chadwick modified the Manchester design to include four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines instead of two.  A total of 7,366 Lancasters was produced.  Lancasters dropped 600,000 tons of bombs, but were also used to drop food to the Allies and for repatriating 74,000 ex-prisoners of war.  Roy Chadwick was awarded the CBE in 1943, soon after the famous 'Dam Busters' raid, which involved 19 Lancasters.    After the Second World War, Chadwick turned his attention to the development of the Lancaster for more peaceful purposes.  A number of Lancaster fuselages were modified to make them suitable for long-distance passenger service. These were called Lancastrians and began the England-New Zealand express service, reaching Australia in 3½ days.  Chadwick also developed his Lincoln aircraft into the Tudor for passenger service over the Atlantic.  It was the first passenger plane with a pressurised cabin built in the UK.  Chadwick was tragically killed when a test fight of the Tudor II crashed at Woodford Aerodrome in 1947. \\n British Aircraft designer, born in Farnworth in 1893. Chadwick worked as a draughtsman at British Westinghouse in Trafford Park whist attending school and at age 18, in 1911, he began work at A.V. Roe & Co. Ltd as Alliott Verdon-Roe's personal assistant. He was appointed Avro's Chief Designer in 1918.   Chadwick designed a number of planes for AVRO, including the Avro F in 1912, the WW1 light bomber and training plane, the Avro 504, the Avro Avian and the Lancaster bomber.    Chadwick died on 23 August 1947 in a crash during the takeoff of the prototype Avro Tudor 2 G-AGSU from Woodford Aerodrome. \\n Educated at Manchester College of Technology; in 1911 he became associated with Alliott Verdon-Roe, a pioneer of British aviation; formed A V Roe & Co.

The 652A Anson became a training plane and over 11,000 were built in the UK and Canada.   In 1939 Avro, by then part of the Hawker Siddeley Group, opened a new works at Chadderton and Chadwick moved his design team there.  At Chadderton, production began on the twin-engined Anson and the Manchester bomber, the forerunner of the famous [[Lancaster]].  Chadwick modified the Manchester design to include four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines instead of two.  A total of 7,366 Lancasters was produced.  Lancasters dropped 600,000 tons of bombs, but were also used to drop food to the Allies and for repatriating 74,000 ex-prisoners of war.  Roy Chadwick was awarded the CBE in 1943, soon after the famous 'Dam Busters' raid, which involved 19 Lancasters.    After the Second World War, Chadwick turned his attention to the development of the Lancaster for more peaceful purposes.  A number of Lancaster fuselages were modified to make them suitable for long-distance passenger service. These were called Lancastrians and began the England-New Zealand express service, reaching Australia in 3½ days.  Chadwick also developed his Lincoln aircraft into the Tudor for passenger service over the Atlantic.  It was the first passenger plane with a pressurised cabin built in the UK.  Chadwick was tragically killed when a test fight of the Tudor II crashed at Woodford Aerodrome in 1947. \\n British Aircraft designer, born in Farnworth in 1893. Chadwick worked as a draughtsman at British Westinghouse in Trafford Park whist attending school and at age 18, in 1911, he began work at A.V. Roe & Co.

Chadwick designed a number of planes for AVRO, including the Avro F in 1912, the WW1 light bomber and training plane, the Avro 504, the Avro Avian and the Lancaster bomber.    Chadwick died on 23 August 1947 in a crash during the takeoff of the prototype Avro Tudor 2 G-AGSU from Woodford Aerodrome. \\n Educated at Manchester College of Technology; in 1911 he became associated with Alliott Verdon-Roe, a pioneer of British aviation; formed A V Roe & Co.

       "   'text': \"Roy Chadwick was born in Farnworth, Lancashire, in 1893.  After leaving school, he served as an apprentice draughtsman at the engineering firm British Westinghouse in Trafford Park, near Manchester.  During this period he studied at the Manchester College of Technology and was an avid model maker.  He joined the Manchester Aero Club and, through its activities, visited the A. V. Roe & Co. factory at [[Brownsfield Mill]] in Ancoats.  In 1911 Chadwick began work for A. V. Roe & Co. as a draughtsman and became Alliott Roe’s personal assistant. He showed a great talent for design and his career progressed rapidly.  He designed the fuselage and undercarriage for the famous Avro 504 which became the standard training aircraft used by the Royal Air Force. In 1918, 500 of these planes were being made per month.   In 1919 A. V. Roe appointed Chadwick as the company’s Chief Designer.  He was involved in the design of every subsequent Avro aircraft until his death in 1947.  In the inter-war years, Avro focused on planes used for joyriding and cross-country flight.  Chadwick’s Avro Baby won several races in 1919 and 1920.  It was also used for Bert Hinkler’s non-stop flights from Croydon to Turin and Riga. Chadwick also designed the Avro 554 floatplane for the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition to the Antarctic in 1921.  By the late 1920s, flying clubs and private enthusiasts wanted to buy new purpose-built civilian aeroplanes instead of military surplus aircraft.  Chadwick designed the Avian which was used in Hinkler’s solo flight to Australia in 15½ days. This record stood for nearly three years until Kingford Smith beat the time in a faster Avian.   In 1933, Avro was invited to modify the Imperial Airways 652 design to make it suitable for coastal reconnaissance.  The 652A Anson became a training plane and over 11,000 were built in the UK and Canada.   In 1939 Avro, by then part of the Hawker Siddeley Group, opened a new works at Chadderton and Chadwick moved his design team there.  At Chadderton, production began on the twin-engined Anson and the Manchester bomber, the forerunner of the famous Lancaster.  Chadwick modified the Manchester design to include four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines instead of two.  A total of 7,366 Lancasters was produced.  Lancasters dropped 600,000 tons of bombs, but were also used to drop food to the Allies and for repatriating 74,000 ex-prisoners of war.  Roy Chadwick was awarded the CBE in 1943, soon after the famous 'Dam Busters' raid, which involved 19 Lancasters.    After the Second World War, Chadwick turned his attention to the development of the Lancaster for more peaceful purposes.  A number of Lancaster fuselages were modified to make them suitable for long-distance passenger service. These were called Lancastrians and began the England-New Zealand express service, reaching Australia in 3½ days.
