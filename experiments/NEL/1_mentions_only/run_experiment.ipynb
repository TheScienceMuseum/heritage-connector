Grace\\'s Guide: http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/London,_Brighton_and_South_Coast_Railway \\n The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) was formed on 27 July 1846, when the London and Brighton, and London and Croydon Railways were merged together.  The LBSCR stretched from London to Portsmouth and Hastings and the length of the track by the end of 1922 totalled 457 miles. This was comprised of 100 miles of single track, 357 miles of double line, 47 miles with three tracks, 35 miles of four tracks and 14 miles (cumulatively) with five tracks.   The LBSCR entered Victoria station in 1860, agreeing to pay half of the costs for the construction of the station. The line from Victoria to Brighton was electrified in three stages, which reached Tulse Hill and West Norwood by 1912. Due to the increasing threat from the tram network the LBSCR decided to use an overhead line instead of a third rail for electrification.  In 1893 the line was one of the pioneers of electric lighting in carriages, with 300 coaches lit. The company ran a first-class Pullman service named the \"Southern Belle\" renamed the \"Brighton Belle\" in 1934. The service made two trips daily from Victoria to Brighton taking exactly one hour in 1909.  LBSCR head offices were in Brighton and the construction of the locomotives took place at Brighton works, locomotives were also built by external contractors, for example Messrs Bury, Curtis and Kennedy, Liverpool. Lancing carriage and wagon works, near Shoreham-by-Sea was built in 1911 in order to relieve pressure of the overcrowded works at Brighton.   The first chairman of the LBSCR was Mr C. P. Grenfell, who was succeeded by Samuel Laing in 1848 (previously the Law Clerk in the Railway Department of the Board of Trade). The first secretary was J. Buckton, succeeded by F. Slight in October 1849. R. Jacomb-Hood was the first resident engineer and Peter Clarke was the first manager, however on the 14 February 1848 strong complaints made against Clarke and he was deemed as inefficient and resigned. He was succeeded by George Hawkins. William Stroudly was appointed locomotive superintendent in 1870. In 1899, William Forbes, (son of the General Manager of the Midland Great Western Railway), became General Manager of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, where he instigated the programme of overhead electrification. He is also credited with rebuilding Victoria station, extending the Pullman services, and building the Quarry line. During the war he was a member of the Railway Executive. He received a knighthood in 1915.  The LBSCR also owned the Terminus Hotel in Brighton and the London and Paris Hotel at Newhaven, to encourage more tourists to use the railway.  In 1923, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) was absorbed into the Southern Railway, as part of the ‘grouping’ process which organised railway companies into the  ‘Big Four’. \\n 1846 - formed when London and Brighton and London and Croydon railways combined. 1923 - became a constituent of the Southern Railways under the Railways Act 1922 (The Grouping Act).',\n",

Originally situated at premises adjacent to the recently completed London Road station, Manchester.  The company prospered, and they soon branched out into other areas of manufacturing. It is recorded in a directory of 1857 referring to them being manufacturers of engineering tools, including drills, cutter, lathe tools etc. As the business prospered it was necessary to move to new premises in Salford at Victoria works, Springfield Lane. The company were involved in making every conceivable kind of machine tool, it was unusual to make machines to customers specifications. Eventually Kendall & Gent to build a completely new works on a site in Gorton, Manchester. The new works, also named Victoria Works was opened in 1897.  They continued to expand on the site, especially during the First World War when demand for machine tools increased dramatically. Kendall & Gent were one of the founder members of the Associated British Machine Tool Makers which was formed in 1917.   The company underwent a reorganisation in 1920 and became a public limited company under F.C. Mosley, who became Chairman and Managing Director of the new company. The company underwent further expansion and new bays were added to the existing buildings between 1938 and 1956.  In 1959 the shareholders of the company were approached by W. E.

The company was founded in 1926. However, the company had its origins earlier in the decade: the Chief Photographer and Managing Director George Mewes had been a photojournalist and a documentary film-maker. In the early 1920s, he and the other founding members of staff were employees and shareholders of a film studio, the Castle Film Company in Ealing. Other founding members were Walter Nunn (Company Secretary) and Oliver Locker Lampson (Chairman).   The company moved to studios at 108 Victoria Street, in Victoria, London. They had large and extensive studios to allow the complex sets advertising photography often required. Their studios were furnished with room sets, household objects and, after a large number of commissions from the Amalgamated Press Group, a fully fitted studio kitchen.  The company's clients included Canadian Pacific, Swan Hellenistic, Union Castle Cruises, Cunard and various automobile companies.   The company expanded into a second studio in Manchester before the second world war. Their Manchester studio was based at 196 Deansgate and was similarly equipped and designed to serve Northern clients. Gordon La Masurier, who joined the company in 1931, was sent to set up the studios. Less successful than anticipated, it closed shortly after the war.   The London studio stayed open with a skeleton staff during the second world war. The company took a lot of magazine photography in the 1950s, and worked for catalogue companies including Littlewoods when times were tough.   The company moved to new London studios in Murray House, also in Victoria, in 1961. However, the 1960s saw the gradual decline of the company, and the company was put into voluntary liquidation in 1970 and dissolved in 1977. \\n Founded by George Mewes in 1926, Photographic Advertising Limited were an advertising photography studio specialising in stock photography, advertising films, and commissions. The studio had a large library of stock photographs and a varied portfolio of clients; Mewes established a strong corporate identity, where all work was credited to Photographic Advertising Limited rather than to the individual photographers.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'In 1854, Charles Frederick Beyer and Richard Peacock founded Beyer, Peacock & Co, a mechanical engineering company.  Their works and foundry were at Gorton, east of Manchester.  A legal partnership was formed between Charles Frederick Beyer, Richard Peacock, and Henry Robertson, a sleeping partner which took effect from 1 January 1855.  In 1883 the company was incorporated as a private limited company and renamed Beyer, Peacock & Co Ltd, with registered offices at 34 Victoria Street, Westminster.  In 1902 the company became a public limited company, Beyer, Peacock & Co (1902) Ltd. Company No. 00073505. (The (1902) was dropped the following year).  In 1908 the registered offices were moved to Gorton and the new London office was at 14 Victoria Street, Westminster.  In 1919 the London offices were given up and then in 1923 new premises were acquired at Abbey House, London.  During WWII the registered offices were moved to Flore Manor in Northamptonshire.  In 1956 the London offices of the company were moved from Abbey House to Locomotive House, Buckingham Gate.  In 1960 the company and its subsidiary companies became members of the Beyer, Peacock Group.  Beyer, Peacock & Co Ltd became the name of the Holding Company and the part of the business at Gorton was named Beyer, Peacock Gorton Ltd.  In 1966 all production ceased at Gorton Foundry.  Shares in Beyer, Peacock were eventually bought out by National Chemical Industries Ltd and in 1980 Beyer, Peacock & Co Ltd became a dormant company.  Beyer, Peacock & Co was set up as a mechanical engineering company and made steam locomotive engines and light machines.  They made their locomotives for companies worldwide, mainly for the colonies, South Africa and South America.  In 1908, Beyer, Peacock started making the Garratt, an articulated locomotive designed by H W Garratt.  A patent was granted Garratt for this engine and Beyer, Peacock had sole rights of manufacture in Britain.  In 1928 the patents ran out and the company began to use the name Beyer-Garratt to distinguish their locomotives. During WWI Beyer, Peacock began to manufacture artillery and in August 1915 Gorton Works was put under government control with production switching almost entirely to the war effort, especially heavy field artillery.  During WWII the company was again brought under government control but continued to build locomotives throughout the war.  Beyer, Peacock was faced with competition from tramways and electric railways.  They began to look for alternatives so that they were not dependent on one product.  In 1932 they acquired Richard Garratt Engineering Works Ltd who made steam traction engines, steam road lorries, and agricultural equipment.  In 1949 Metropolitan-Vickers, Beyer, Peacock Ltd was formed which was jointly owned by Metropolitan Vickers and Beyer, Peacock.  The company was created to build locomotives other than steam.  By 1953 Beyer, Peacock had acquired the following subsidiary companies: Denings of Chard, makers of agricultural machinery; Theramic Ltd, makers of theramic siphons for locomotives; Maiuri Refrigeration Patents, Low Temperature Developments Ltd, and some other companies concerned with sales, such as Rail Traction Supplied Ltd.  In 1957 Beyer, Peacock acquired Anti-attrition Metal Co and in 1958 Air Control Installations Ltd.  In this year Beyer, Peacock (Hymek) Ltd was formed. The late 1950s saw a rapid transformation in locomotive manufacture.  In 1955 British Rail decided to switch from steam to diesel and overseas users followed suit.  Beyer, Peacock all but closed down the Gorton plant at the end of 1958.  They had chosen to make diesel-hydraulics but British Rail opted to use diesel-electrics.   In the early days of the company it was the partners who managed the affairs of the company.  Beyer acted as Chief Engineer with control over the Drawing Office and Works; Peacock as Commercial Manager handled the commercial side. \\n  \\n REF: http://www.beyerpeacock.co.uk/history/History%20of%20Beyer%20Peacock.html REF: http://beyerpeacock.co.uk/150years/Beyer%20Peacock%20150%20years%20on.PDF WIKI http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyer_Peacock CH: http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//compdetails GG: http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Beyer,_Peacock_and_Co',\n",

       "  'description': \"Aubrey Franks set up his business as an optician and fine art dealer in King Street in about 1878.  For several years, the specialty of the business was spectacles, but Aubrey soon began to make and sell other optical instruments, such as microscopes, telescopes and magic lanterns.  In about 1881, the company acquired additional premises which gave it a commanding position at the corner of King Street and Deansgate.  Seven years later, Aubrey took over his father Joseph's business on Market Street.  Aubrey's business prospered and, by the 1890s, sold all kinds of optical and mathematical instruments, photographic and electrical equipment.  One of his products, the Presto camera, was a very simple, fairly cheap camera, which was quite successful: Aubrey had sold more than 28,000 in 10 years, some of which were sold in Europe.  In 1897, the firm gave the first demonstration of Edison's cinematograph in the north of England.  In about 1917, the business was taken over by Aubrey's son-in-law, Maurice Saffer, who kept the company's name, A. Franks Ltd.  He was an astute and enterprising businessman who expanded the business considerably.  Under his management, Franks Ltd became the first firm to bring radio and television to the Manchester area.  During the 1920s, the firm's main premises remained at King Street/Deansgate, but there were also branches on Oxford Street, Victoria Street and Market Street, a wholesale department on South King Street and a branch at Bradshaw Gate in Bolton.  The Victoria Street branch had been taken over from the optician Aaron Aronsberg.  In 1927, Manchester's first television picture was received ‘by wireless’ at the Market Street shop.  Three years later, televisions were being offered for sale at Market Street and Deansgate.  At the time, a television set cost twenty-five guineas.  The firm continued to prosper and was managed by Maurice Saffer until his death in 1947.  As he had no children, his secretary managed the business for three years and then sold it to the opticians Dollond & Aitchison in 1950. \\n Aubrey Franks set up his business as an optician and fine art dealer in King Street in about 1878.

       "  'description': 'Frederick was an English civil engineer known best for his 35 years as the Chief Engineer of London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR).  In 1844 he joined the civil engineering business of Charles Cawley, and was directly responsible for setting out the first few miles of the Manchester, Bury and Rossendale Railway (MB&RR). \\n  \\n LBSCR Chief Resident Engineer 1860-1896 Major projects During his 35 years in residence as Chief Engineer, Banister was responsible for identifying and then the design, surveying and construction of all the extensions and important works to be undertaken by the LB&SCR. These included: 1862 South London line extension to London Bridge: this involved the construction of 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of viaduct for three lines of rails; and the construction of a 186 feet (57 m) bow-string-girder bridge over Bacon’s tannery 1862 extension of London Bridge: Banister gained an Act of Parliament to enlarge London Bridge further, building four more platforms in an adjoining area to the south to cope with additional traffic generated by the completion of the South London line and other suburban lines to Victoria station.[5] In plans laidout and designs approved by Banister, J. Hawkshaw engineered and constructed a single-span trussed-arch roof measuring 88 ft by 655 ft (27m by 200m). Design and engineering of the East Grinstead, Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells Railway: the extension of the Three Bridges to East Grinstead Railway to link with the SER at Tunbridge Wells Central via Tunbridge Wells West, in a race with the SER. Extensions to the Wealden Line: redesign railway access to Lewes and then Uckfield, before extending the Wealden Line to Eridge to link with the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells West line Widening of the line from Victoria to Streatham; and the widening of the line from East Croydon to Coulsdon 1876 Portsmouth extension: redesigning the existing Portsmouth Direct Line terminus at Portsmouth and Southsea, to allow extension of the tracks to a new station at Portsmouth Harbour, thus giving direct connection to the companies paddle steamer services to the Isle of Wight 1877 design of the Lewes and East Grinstead Railway: including Imberhorne Viaduct, now better known as the Bluebell Railway 1880 extension of the Cuckoo Line: extension of the Cuckoo Line north from Hailsham to Eridge[9] 1881 construction of the Chichester to Midhurst railway: built to a very grand style with a double track loading gauge, despite only ever being single tracked. The stations confirmed to Banister\\'s preferred Italianate architecture style, each formed in the form of a large \"Country House\". Lavant and Cocking each had two platforms, while the grand Singleton was built with four platforms and long sidings for the Goodwood Racecourse traffic. Banister also extended and rebuilt Midhurst in the same architectural style 1884 construction of the Oxted Line: by now having passed the regional \"race\" stage, the LB&SCR and the South Eastern Railway (SER) co-operated on the design and construction of the Oxted Line from South Croydon to Erdidge Junction on the SER\\'s Redhill to Tonbridge Line.[6] Banister then extended the LB&SCR\\'s lines south from the joint station at Hurst Green in two directions: one to East Grinstead; and a later second to Eridge Rebuilding railway stations: Banister had a love of Italianate architecture,[10] which is reflected in his rebuilding of various stations, including:[1] Brighton; Chichester; East Croydon; Eastbourne; Epsom Downs; Newhaven; Seaford; Sutton; Tunbridge Wells',\n",
