Glass is fluid at high temperatures and its fluidity decreases as the temperature is reduced. Glass does not have a specific melting or freezing point but gradually changes from the solid state to the liquid state as the temperature is increased. This property of variable viscosity is used when glass is formed into objects, whether of beauty or utility.The two manufacturing processes for producing flat glass in the UK are the float glass method and rolling. In rolling a continuous stream of molten glass is poured between water-cooled rollers. Made in England, United Kingdom.\n",

The Midland Railway became an equal partner in 1866.   The Committee came into effect following the passing of the Cheshire Lines Transfer Act in 1865.

However it did not become wholly independant until the Cheshire Lines Act of 1867. In the 1923 grouping, the parent companies became part of the London Midland & Scottish Railways and then in 1948 became part of British Railways.

The company was founded by the brothers Heinrich, Max and Josef Wirgin in 1920. They introduced their first distinctive camera in 1927, the Edinex, which they produced also as Adrette for Adox. In 1967 the Franka-Werk was closed. In 1968 Henry Wirgin closed his original company and continued the production of some camera models in a new smaller plant. In 1971, shortly before its closing, the company introduced a quite modern but heavy SLR camera.\n",

      "The Gloucester-born poet William Henley is perhaps best known as the inspiration behind the literary figure Long John Silver in Treasure Island. He was close friend of Robert Louis Stevenson, with whom he wrote three plays in the 1890s. While he was still a boy, Henley’s life was threatened after he developed tuberculosis of the bone. As the disease progressed, he had one of his legs amputated just below the knee. When physicians suggested his other leg be amputated, Henley sought alternative treatment. He was admitted to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where he was treated by Joseph Lister, using his antiseptic surgical methods. Over the next few years, Lister eventually saved Henley’s leg, and possibly his life.  Henley's period of hospitalisation and his experiences as a patient in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary are recorded in his poem 'In Hospital' (1874). The poem describes the experience of hospitalisation from admission to discharge and, among other things, charts the rise of the Nightingale-style nurse in the second half of the1800s. Following his recovery in 1889, Henley became editor of the Scots Observer. Transferred to London and renamed the National Observer, the journal remained under Henley’s editorship until 1893. His literary connections led his daughter to be similarly immortalised, as Wendy in J M Barrie’s classic, Peter Pan. Unlike her father, she died while still a child. Both daughter and father were buried in the churchyard in Cockayne Hatley, Bedfordshire.\n",

Presented to the Royal Society his elaborately constructed, circumstantial and obsessively held Lope de Vega theory, many years in the forming, that two Spanish ships, the Santa Ysabel and Santa Barbara, had found their way into Sydney Harbour, stayed several years and left in 1600, only to be wrecked on their voyage home.  1966-1994 - featured on the obverse of the Australian $20 note.\n",
