Heritage Connector documentation
================================

The Heritage Connector is a framework for automatically connecting items within and across `GLAM`_ collections and  publications through linking with `Wikidata`_. It achieves this by applying the following techniques *(links to follow)*:

- knowledge graphs
- disambiguation
- named entity recognition & linking.

.. _glam: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAM_(industry_sector)
.. _wikidata: https://www.wikidata.org/

.. note:: We're still actively developing the Heritage Connector and documentation will be written as features are added.
